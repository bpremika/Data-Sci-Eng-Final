        "Title": "Comparative Electrical Energy Yield Performance of Micro-Inverter PV Systems Using a Machine Learning Approach Based on a Mixed-Effect Model of Real Datasets",
        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 IEEE.Long-term energy evaluation of PV systems that use micro-inverter configuration (micro-inverter PV systems) is currently unclear due to the lacking of sufficient longitudinal measurement data and appropriate analysis method. The poor knowledge about impact and aging of micro-inverter PV system affects the comprehension and accuracy of PV design and simulation tools. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach based on the mixed-effect model to compare and evaluate the electrical energy yield of micro-inverter PV systems. The analyzed results using a 5-year period data of PV stations located at Concord, Massachusetts, USA showed that there is no significant difference in yearly electrical energy yield of micro-inverter PV systems under shading and non-shading condition. This finding has confirmed the advantage of micro-inverter PV system over the other PV types. In addition, our work is the first study that identified the average degradation rate of micro-inverter PV of 3% per year (95% confidence intervals: 2%-4.3%). Our findings in this study have extended substantially the comprehensive understanding of micro-inverter PV system."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.Novel near-infrared (NIR) light-induced bio-based shape memory polymers (SMPs) were prepared from copolymers of vanillin/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine monomer (V-fa monomer) and epoxidized castor oil (ECO). Incorporation of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as photothermal fillers into the copolymers provided shape memory properties under near-infrared (NIR) light actuation. The effects of GNP content on photothermal, thermal, dynamic mechanical, morphology, and shape memory properties of the bio-based benzoxazine/epoxy copolymers (V-fa/ECO copolymers) were investigated. The results showed that the addition of GNPs significantly improved the photothermal, thermal, and dynamic mechanical properties of the copolymers. The uniform dispersion of 3 wt% GNPs in the V-fa/ECO copolymers resulted in the highest shape memory performance with shape fixity of 92% and shape recovery of 99% upon NIR light actuation. The recovery time decreased with the increment of GNP content, and the V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs displayed good execution in the repeated fold-deploy, in which the shape fixity and shape recovery values were close to the original specimen. Therefore, the outstanding properties of V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs had a potential to be excellent SMPs under NIR actuation."

The hydrolysate obtained using Alcalase\u00ae showed the highest NO scavenging activity. This hydrolysate was fractionated using 10-, 5-, and 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes, and the lowest MW fraction (<3 kDa) exhibited the highest NO scavenging activity. The <3 kDa fraction was further purified by gel filtration and high-performance liquid chromatographies. The peptides in the HPLC fraction with the strongest anti-NO activity were identified by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry as LSPLLAAH (821.48 Da) and TVNLAYY (843.42 Da). Both peptides and the corresponding pure synthetic peptides inhibited NO production by RAW 264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that peptides LSPLLAAH and TVNLAYY reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes iNOS, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, suggesting that these peptides are novel anti-inflammatory candidates."

For an N-class problem, in the worst case the proposed method requires only N +1 binary classifiers to obtain the classification result as same as in the traditional framework. Our proposed method will properly create the necessary set of One-Versus-One (OVO) classifiers corresponding to OVA data inseparabilities in advance. On the other hand, it will not needlessly construct an OVO classifier if the data separability between that pair of classes is good enough. This is more practical than the traditional A&O technique that suggests to train OVO classifiers on-demand which consumes time while the system is in use. Especially in same cases of real-time applications, it may be very important to keep high speed response and maintain highly accurate results. Experimental results show that the proposed technique gives significantly better performance compared to the OVA and the traditional A&O techniques, while providing comparable accuracy compared to the OVO method. Moreover, a required number of binary classifiers in our proposed method is considerably smaller than in the OVO approach as similar as in the OVA and the traditional A&O techniques."

The most common sensors that can be found are location sensor and acceleration sensor. The sensors generate a lot of useful data which could be applied for many future applications such as car tracking or emergency warning. One of the most interesting applications among others is analyzing the driver behavior. There are some previous works using this information to define types of drivers that are related to levels of accident risk. However, the driver behavior not only can separate the type of drivers but also can identify driving characteristic of an individual driver. The driver identification benefits a security application and it can eliminate the global car theft issue. Because the driver behavior cannot be repeated or copied like other anti-theft systems so this is an essential solution to stop increasing the number of stolen cars every year. In this paper, we propose a methodology to identify each driver and classify group of drivers using only accelerating behavior with machine learning technique. In order to identify an individual driver, the acceleration data have been transformed to a histogram in order to represent the accelerating behavior then we utilize a neural network model. We evaluate our methodology with data that have been collected from the acceleration sensors installed on 13 shuttle buses in our campus for more than 10 months. The results show the accuracy of the proposed methodology up to 88.3% for driver identification and up to 92% for driver classification."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 by ASME.An accurate and practical approach is necessary for predicting oil fraction in horizontal oil-water flows. In this study, a concept of a drift-flux model is adopted to develop a predictive method for the oil fraction in the horizontal oil-water flows due to its simplicity and practicality. A new drift-flux correlation for the horizontal oil-water flows is developed based on the least square method using collected experimental data. The distribution parameter is determined to be 1.05 for the data with the ratio of oil density to water density ranging from 0.787 to 1.00, whereas the oil fraction weighted mean drift velocity is set at 0 m/s due to the flow direction perpendicular to the gravity direction. The physical meaning for the order of unity of the distribution parameter is explained by introducing a simple model. The predictive capability of the new drift-flux correlation is examined using the collected database of oil-water flows in horizontal pipes under a variety of test conditions. It is demonstrated that the new drift-flux correlation can predict the existing oil fractions in the horizontal pipe channels with the mean absolute error, standard deviation, mean relative deviation, and mean absolute relative deviation being 0.0124, 0.0338,-3.25%, and 9.57%, respectively."

So, the channel decoding schemes used to decode the received codeword must be properly analyzed for efficient utilization of 5G. This paper performed a comparative analysis of the distinct channel state-based capabilities of decoding of the two different contenders of polar code decoders: 1) Successive Cancelation (SC) decoder and 2) Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder. Here we have analyzed both the decoders in terms of the various combinations of high and low Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) of the received codewords from the channel. This investigation has revealed that even the SCL decoder always explores more decodable candidates than the SC counterpart, under some specific received codewords the SC may decode better."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In an all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), redox reaction occurs on the fiber surface of the graphite felts. Therefore, the VRFB performance highly depends on the characteristics of the graphite felts. Although atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) have been applied for surface modification of graphite felt electrode in VRFBs for the enhancement of electrochemical reactivity, the influence of APPJ plasma reactivity and working temperature (by changing the flow rate) on the VRFB performance is still unknown. In this work, the performance of the graphite felts with different APPJ plasma reactivity and working temperatures, changed by varying the flow rates (the conditions are denoted as APPJ temperatures hereafter), was analyzed and compared with those treated with sulfuric acid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the APPJ treatment led to an increase in O-/N-containing functional groups on the GF surface to ~21.0% as compared to ~15.0% for untreated GF and 18.0% for H2SO4-treated GF. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the surface morphology of graphite felt electrodes was still smooth, and no visible changes were detected after oxidation in the sulfuric acid or after APPJ treatment. The polarization measurements indicated that the APPJ treatment increased the limiting current densities from 0.56 A\u00b7cm\u22122 for the GFs treated by H2SO4 to 0.64, 0.68, and 0.64 A\u00b7cm\u22122, respectively, for the GFs APPJ-treated at 450, 550, and 650\u25e6C, as well as reduced the activation overpotential when compared with the H2SO4-treated electrode. The electrochemical charge/discharge measurements showed that the APPJ treatment temperature of 550\u25e6C gave the highest energy efficiency of 83.5% as compared to 72.0% with the H2SO4 treatment."

All rights reserved.With every passing day, the demand for data traffic is increasing, and this urges the research community not only to look for an alternating spectrum for communication but also urges radio frequency planners to use the existing spectrum efficiently. Cell sizes are shrinking with every upcoming communication generation, which makes base station placement planning even more complex and cumbersome. In order tomake the next-generation cost-effective, it is important to design a network in such a way that it utilizes the minimum number of base stations while ensuring seamless coverage and quality of service. This paper aims at the development of a new simulation-based optimization approach using a hybrid metaheuristic and metamodel applied in a novel mathematical formulation of the multi-transmitter placement planning (MTPP) problem. We first develop a new mathematical programming model for MTPP that is flexible to design the locations for any number of transmitters. To solve this constrained optimization problem, we propose a hybrid approach using the radial basis function (RBF) metamodel to assist the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) by mitigating the associated computational burden of the optimization procedure.We evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm by simulating the MTPP model with two, three, four and five transmitters and estimating the Pareto front for optimal locations of transmitters. The quantitative results show that almost maximum signal coverage can be obtained with four transmitters; thus, it is not a wise idea to use higher number of transmitters in the model. Furthermore, the limitations and future works are discussed."

The ranges of metal concentration (mg kg-1) were 9.04 - 32.17 mg kg-1 and 6.33 - 36.52 mg kg-1 of Pb in Core A and B; and 32.83 - 68.49 mg kg-1 and 21.63 - 73.59 mg kg-1 of Zn in Core A and B, which is below the Sediment Quality Guidelines of Threshold Effects Concentration (TEC) (35.8 mg Pb kg-1 and 121 mg Zn kg-1). Sn was not detected (< 0.03 mg kg-1). Analysis of the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) clearly indicated that most of the analysed sediment samples were not contaminated with the studied metals since low Igeo values were observed (Igeo Pb and Igeo Zn < 0). The detected enrichment factor (EFPb) values between 2.0 and 6.0 indicated moderate enrichment, while most of the sediments had EFZn values below 2 which exhibited deficiency to minimal enrichment. The EF values in this study (EF > 1.5) indicates a significant portion of the trace metals was delivered from non-crustal materials and that may be delivered by other sources. Correlation analysis showed positive relationships between Pb and Zn in both cores (r = 0.5** Core A and 0.941** Core B). The association of Pb and Zn is possibly because they originated from the same sources. The determination of other metals should be considered further."

One of the features associated with the honeycomb monoliths is the demonstrated low pressure drops in processes involving high flow rates. Honeycomb monoliths, with a range of structures, have found increasingly promising applications in various industries. Owing to their physical structures, they keep finding new applications in industrial treatment systems. They are mainly fabricated via two different techniques: extrusion and coating. Monoliths fabricated via each of these techniques demonstrate specific characteristics suitable for a certain number of applications. With the presence of cordierite substrate in the coated monoliths, higher mechanical strength of coated honeycomb monoliths is expected when compared to the integral monoliths. The coated monoliths are suitable when mechanical strength is of importance where the adhesion of the thin layer coating on monoliths is a determining factor in the performance of the entire process. The integral monoliths are most-commonly employed in gas-phase processes rather than liquid phase applications due to their high accessible surface area per total weight (or volume) of the monoliths. Embedding mesoporous carbon coating and nanoparticles into honeycomb monoliths has improved the efficiency of monoliths in comparison to the more conventional preparation methods."

Suitable amount of Ce- and La-doping increases OC carbon tolerance. The solubility limit is found at 50 mol% La in solid solution. At higher La-doping, La2O3 disperses on the surface and adsorbs CO2 forming La2O2CO3 during FFS.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier LtdA novel anaerobic baffled biofilm-membrane bioreactor (AnBB-MBR) was developed to treat industrial liquor condensate. In order to minimize membrane fouling, three different reactor configurations of R1:No media (anaerobic baffled MBR), R2:FF (Fixed Film AnBB-MBR) and R3:FF + MVB (Fixed Film and Moving Bed AnBB-MBR) were evaluated at the same operating hydraulic retention time of 3 days. The specific fouling rates of the ceramic membranes were 0.98, 0.84 and 0.5 kPa/L/m2 for R1:No media, R2:FF and R3:FF + MVB, respectively. The R2:FF and R3:FF + MVB reactors could mitigate the membrane fouling rates by 14.1% and 48.9%, compared to R1:No media due to biomass retention in the fixed film and mechanical scouring of the MVB. From the microbial community analysis, higher relative abundances of Methanosaeta were found in the biofilm whereas more Methanobacterium was found in the suspended sludge. Moreover, higher accumulations of humic and fulvic substances in the system could inhibit the methanogenic activity."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) is an important part of the distribution system that can provide data from customers for utilities to monitor. With the help of communication technology, it can also be used for outage management. When outages occur, AMR may send outage notification to utilities for assessing the situation. AMR can also be polled at any time to determine power and status. However, it would not be efficient for utilities to poll every meter in an affected area of the network due to time and data constraints especially with Low-Power Wide-Area Network as LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN technology can provide very long-range transmission with low power consumption. However, it also has some restrictions including a limited payload, capacity and network size. This paper explains how LoRaWAN can be employed in an AMR setting, including for the on-demand reading feature and the polling algorithm for outage management system (OMS), which is used to identify system conditions."

The present study demonstrates a label-free detection of DNA using a nanofluidic device based on impedance measurements that is both sensitive and simple to operate. Using this device, the electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis effect on DNA conformation and the length dependence were examined. A low alternating voltage was applied to the nanogap electrodes to generate a high intensity field (>0.5 MV/m) under non-faradaic conditions. In addition, a 100 nm thick gold electrode was completely embedded in the substrate to allow direct measurements of a solution containing the sample passing through the gap, without any surface modification required. The high intensity field in this device produced a dielectrophoretic force that stretched the DNA molecule across the electrode gap at a specific frequency, based on back and forth movements between the electrodes with the DNA in a random coil conformation. The characteristics of 100 bp, 500 bp, 1 kbp, 5 kbp, 10 kbp, and 48 kbp \u03bb DNA associated with various conformations were quantitatively analyzed with high resolution (on the femtomolar level). The sensitivity of this system was found to be more than about 10 orders of magnitude higher than that obtained from conventional linear alternating current (AC) impedance for the analysis of bio-polymers. This new high-sensitivity process is expected to be advantageous with regard to the study of complex macromolecules and nanoparticles."

It illustrates how much power plant a country plans to build to meet future demand. At present, one of the great challenges for the system planner is to develop a PDP that can confront with high growth of demand as well as high growth of the renewable energy. As the renewable energy is highly penetrated, it creates high uncertainty and intermittency to the power grid in such a way that, sometimes, typical conventional power plant cannot be quick enough to response. Many recent researches suggest that the energy storage system or ESS should be installed to cope with this problem. This paper proposed a method to develop a PDP considering installation of the ESS. The key factor determining whether a power grid requires a new plant or a new ESS is an index modified from Reserved Margin (RM). To illustrate the advantage of the proposed method, new power development plan (PDP) done by the proposed method is then compared to the Thailand's current plan, PDP2018."

Due to a number of defective units that were found at the final inspection process, high scraps may be escaped to customers. The problem comes from poor quality control process which is not efficient enough to filter defective products from in-process because there is no In-Process Quality Control (IPQC) or sampling inspection in the process. Therefore, the quality control process has to be improved by setting inspection gates and IPCQs at critical processes in order to filter the defective products. The critical processes are analysed by the FMEA method. IPQC is used for detecting defective products and reducing chances of defective finished goods escaped to the customers. Reducing proportion of defective finished goods also decreases scrap cost because finished goods incur higher scrap cost than work in-process. Moreover, defective products that are found during process can reflect the abnormal processes; therefore, engineers and operators should timely solve the problems. Improved quality control was implemented for 7-Flex production lines from July 2017 to September 2017. The result shows decreasing of the average proportion of defective finished goods and the average of Customer Manufacturers Lot Reject Rate (%LRR of CMs) equal to 4.5% and 4.1% respectively. Furthermore, cost saving of this quality control process equals to 100K Baht."

While the impact of these inland terminal on the efficiency of multimodal transportation has recently become more evident, it is relatively challenging to evaluate dry port's performance, as it typically involves with many operations performed by different gate operators with different numbers of container handling equipment (CHE). To properly evaluate dry port's performance, in this paper, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is proposed and implemented in SIMIO modeling platform based on the current data of Ladkrabang Inland Container Depot (LICD), Thailand. According to our results, we have found that, currently, all CHE types at the LICD are not well utilized, especially the internal trucks, as the frequency of trains arriving at the LICD is still far too few. We also find that the utilization of CHE does not significant change as we vary the proportion of cargo transported by trains to trucks from 30:70 to 50:50, while maintaining total container flow. As such, we suggest that gate operators should form a CHE sharing agreement in order to improve CHE efficiency, and so the LICD's, which would be crucial for their survivability, especially after the post pandemic."

It was found that carboxyl methyl cellulose can be employed as pre-agglomeration stabilizer to obtain high dispersion of hydrophilic cellulose fibers in hydrophobic natural rubber latex. The incorporation of cellulose fibers into the natural rubber matrix significantly improved the crystallinity of the composite films. At the highest loading content of cellulose at 50% w/w, the uptake toluene of the film was reduced to only 5%, whereas its tensile strength was increased to 100 times higher than the neat rubber film. Thermal stability was decreased slightly, depending on cellulose fiber loading content, but the glass transition temperature remained constant at about \u2212 64 \u00b0C. According to the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, the water absorption capacity and water vapor transmission of the composite films were enhanced.

Previously, the optimal technologies of the biorefinery-integrated pulping processes were successfully determined in the synthesis stage providing the highest cost-effective incorporation; 48 million USD/year of profit was estimated according to the integration of succinic acid and dimethyl ether productions into the soda pulping process. Herein, the process designs of the integrated processes were performed followed by evaluations of the process performances and identifications of the hot spots and targets for establishments of the innovations. In this work, the biomass gasification option is designed and implemented to enhance the material and energy utilizations in the previously determined biorefinery-integrated pulping processes. Electricity and biofuel are produced and sold, which contributes positively to the economic and environmental impacts of these processes. The hot spots and targets are subsequently identified prior to the innovation stage. According to this stage, the cleaner alternatives that implements the CO2 utilization via methanol synthesis and solar cell installations are selected in order to minimize the CO2 emission. A net CO2 reduction of 42% is achieved when the cleaner alternatives are applied. Accordingly, these biorefinery-integrated innovations are not only conducive to the enhanced sustainability of existing pulp mills but also adaptive in response to the change of paper consumption trend."

The thickness of the oil film between drops decreases and ruptures. As a consequence, the drops coalesce together. However, if the electric field is too high, the resultant drop deforms and disintegrates, reducing the efficiency of the electrocoalescence process. In this work, a multiple-physic simulation is performed to determine the critical electric field that causes the disintegration of an aqueous drop. The configuration is an aqueous drop, located on a grounded electrode in an insulating oil under an electric field. We numerically analyze the deformation and disintegration of a drop under the applied electric field using the finite element method. We use the level set method to track the interface between the aqueous drop and the insulating oil. The results show that the aqueous drop elongates due to the electric force and starts to deform under 0.36 kV/mm electric field. The elongation and the deformation of drop increase with the electric field. Eventually, the aqueous drop completely loses its stability at the critical field value, which is equal to 0.9 kV/mm. An experiment is conducted to observe the disintegration of drop. The experimental results demonstrate that the drop disintegration occurs at the average electric field of 1.02 kV/mm, slightly higher than the critical field obtained from the simulation."

The incorporation of PHA production into wastewater treatment processes is a promising strategy for resource recovery. This study investigated PHA production in two-stage continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)-activated sludge (AS) systems fed with synthetic wastewater containing glycerol. The effects of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) ratios of the first and the second stages, which reflects the feast/famine ratio, at 0.04, 0.15, and 0.33 were examined. RESULTS: The PHA accumulation and PHA consumption patterns under feast/famine conditions were successfully achieved in systems operated at HRT ratios of 0.04, 0.15, and 0.33 with influent glycerol concentrations of 3000 mg COD/L. Then, the sludge from these systems was tested for PHA accumulation in fed-batch reactors. Maximum PHA contents of 21.8 wt%, 13.1 wt%, and 8.7 wt% were obtained for the sludge from the systems operated at HRT ratios of 0.04, 0.15, and 0.33, respectively. From the microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina), the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria decreased, whereas the relative abundances of alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria increased after cultivation in the two-stage CSTR AS systems. CONCLUSION: The highest PHA accumulation was achieved at the lowest HRT ratio of the first and the second stages in the two-stage CSTR AS systems.

In this work, a simple, low-cost and high-throughput fabrication method of high-density microneedle masters is presented. The high-density microneedle masters were fabricated by first machining an aluminium workpiece to form high-density rectangular column arrays using wire-cut electrode discharge machining. Subsequently, the rectangular column arrays were subjected to a chemical etching under a mass-transport limited condition resulting in the formation of conical-shaped microneedle masters without the need of etch mask. For demonstration, the fabricated microneedle masters were used as a template for the fabrication of an inverse polymer mould and subsequently the polymer mould was used for the fabrication of silk microneedles.

Second, a full-cone spray nozzle was used and the average velocities from the two techniques were close, but the off-center collision on the probe and the difference in size limits caused the discrepancy in the size determination. However, the probe is still beneficial to determine the droplet hydrodynamics and local liquid fraction, the essential characteristics of a spray system."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Silk fibroin (SF) hydrogels can be obtained via self-assembly, but this process takes several days or weeks, being unfeasible to produce cell carrier hydrogels. In this work, a phospholipid, namely, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) sodium salt (DMPG), was used to induce and accelerate the gelation process of SF solutions. Due to the amphipathic nature and negative charge of DMPG, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the phospholipids and SF chains will occur, inducing the structural transition of SF chains to the beta sheet and consequently a rapid gel formation is observed (less than 50 min). Moreover, the gelation time can be controlled by varying the lipid concentration. To assess the potential of the hydrogels as cell carriers, several mammalian cell lines, including L929, NIH/3T3, SaOS-2, and CaSki, were encapsulated into the hydrogel. The silk-based hydrogels supported the normal growth of fibroblasts, corroborating their cytocompatibility. Interestingly, an inhibition in the growth of cancer-derived cell lines was observed. Therefore, DMPG-induced SF hydrogels can be successfully used as a 3D platform for in situ cell encapsulation, opening promising opportunities in biomedical applications, such as in cell therapies and tissue regeneration."

Investigation into causes of mutual solubility is very important to prevent instability of the system. This work focuses on the influence of water pH as regards the solubility and stability of SLM. For the organic phase, ionic-liquid extractant viz. Aliquat 336, combining with various organic solvents, was used. As for the aqueous phase, acidic, neutral and basic water was prepared. The solubility of the liquid-liquid ternary systems (adjusted pH water + Aliquat 336 + organic solvents) was carried out at T = 303.2 K and atmospheric pressure. Tie-line data of the ternary systems were also determined. Good correlation of tie-line data from the NRTL model and experiments was confirmed and validated by the root-mean square deviation values which were <2%. For SLM stability, response surface methodology combined with Box-Behnken design was applied to obtain optimal conditions for platinum extraction and stripping. The stability of the system was observed under the different feed pH and optimal conditions."

It is essential for project manager and as a tool to consistently estimate the usage of project time and resources. However, the massive numbers of activities and their complicated dependencies remains difficult to be verified manually. We intend to use a timed Petri net to formally represent the existing massive tasks in the activity network diagram to make it easier for verification. The relationship types between the activities are correctly defined with no conflict in the project plan. The timed Petri net would ease the simulation of the control flows and dependencies among the activities in the project. Moreover, there exist several timed Petri nets simulation and animation tools for the incident investigation and verification. In this paper, we propose a set of rules to map the elements of an activity network diagram into the associate timed Petri nets. The basic four dependency types - finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish, between activities are handled with care. The resulting timed Petri nets are correctly generated and verified by the simulation tool."

Herein, the Hg fraction removal of EK from contaminated marine sediment was investigated appertaining to bipolar electrode settings along with the effects of electrode spacing and configuration considered. Based on the selective sequential Hg extractions (Hg SSE), much of the Hg in the sediment originated from F5 (i.e., HgS) and F4 (i.e., HgO). The F5 fraction removed by EK was about 30 %, while the F4 fraction had a slight increase of about 34 %. When it comes to electrode configuration, a hexagonal pattern has a higher Hg removal performance than that of a rectangular shape. The addition of anodes increases the remediation surface area, thus allowing superior Hg removal. This study indicates that the electrode spacing significantly affects the mercury removal and the remediation time. Determining suitable spacing enhances the electrical potentials in the migration flux."

This increase in the internal temperature can cause unusual disturbances and damage to high voltage electrical equipment. Therefore, early prevention measures of thermal anomalies in equipment are necessary to prevent high voltage equipment failure that might shut down the whole grid system. In this article, we propose a novel non-destructive approach to defect analysis in high voltage equipment by taking advantage of the infrared thermography and the deep learning (DL) approach from the machine learning paradigm. The infrared images of the components were captured using the FLIR T630 without disturbing the operations of the power grid. In the first stage, rich features maps from the convolutional layers of the AlexNet pretrained model were extracted. After feature extraction, the random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) were trained for learning of the defective and non-defective high voltage electrical equipment. In an experimental analysis, the RF optimally learned the separation between defective and non-defective equipment with greater than 96% accuracy, outperforming all the other comparative approaches for deep and nondeep features. The proposed approach based on the RF is reliable and shows its efficacy for fault detection in high voltage electrical equipment."

The life cycle of BOT arrangement can be divided into three phases: the design phase, the construction phase, and the operation phase. In this paper, the focus is on the construction phase since it appears to be the phase with the highest level of risk. Several studies have also found that many large-scale infrastructure projects experienced a chronic problem of construction delay, some of which even led to contract termination. In a PPP setting, the consequences of construction delay can be more acute and thus worth studying. The objective of this research is therefore to evaluate financial impacts resulting from construction delay. Financial model of a hypothetical BOT infrastructure project will be employed in this study. Risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation will also be performed in order to identify level of risk exposed by the project sponsor. The results of this study may provide an insight into how construction risk shall be mitigated and managed by both the public sector and the private sector so as to create a fair and robust BOT contract in the future."

Using CNNs also does not need feature extraction which might leave out other related but unobserved features. CNNs with three to seven convolutional layers were deployed in this research. We measured their performance with a binary classification task for compositions of emotions including arousal and valence. The results showed that our method captured EEG signal patterns from numerous subjects by 10-fold cross validation with 81.54% and 86.87% accuracy from arousal and valence respectively.

It was due to the high content of silica (SiO2) inside rice husk, burning it under the control condition provides ash with the silica content up to 97% which can be simultaneously or consequently extracted to obtain rice husk-derived silica (RHS). In order to valorize the RHS, in this study it was used as a support for zirconocene/MMAO catalyst in ethylene polymerization, compared with commercial silica (CMS). It was found that rice husk-derived silica (RHS) has a larger surface area and lower amount of impurities than CMS. After immobilizing MMAO cocatalyst onto the silicas, it was observed that both silicas exhibit good distribution of MMAO all over the particles, but RHS has a higher content of MMAO. When using both silicas in the polymerization systems, it was observed that RHS gave a higher catalytic activity to the polymerization system than CMS (202 and 150 kg pol/mol Zr h). This is due to RHS having the lower amount of impurities especially Na2O which remains only in CMS from the production of commercial silica. The polymer obtained from the polymerization system with RHS has a good morphology suggesting that RHS still retains the advantage of providing a polymer with a good morphology as same as the conventional silica supports.

Thai Industrial Standard Institute (TISI) has officially announced to use Thai recommendation for lighting of roads for motor and pedestrian traffic, TIS 2954 based on CIE 115 in 2019. This is the first step for such a revision on road lighting standard in Thailand. Three road classes; Motorized traffic (M), Conflict areas (C) and Pedestrian and low speed areas (P) classes were studied and classified based on PD CEN/TR EN 13201-1. Seven test sites were selected: four M lighting classes (M1 to M4), two C lighting classes (C1 and C2) and one P lighting class (P2) were used as case studies. Luminaires with high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps have been initially evaluated and then LED luminaires have replaced HPS luminaires and evaluated for comparisons based on important parameters in EN 13201-2 and -3. Measuring lighting performance was performed based on EN 13201-4 using an Imaging Luminance Measuring Device (ILMD) and illuminance photometer (class L). Energy performance indicators which are power density indicator (DP) and annual energy consumption indicator (DE) based on EN 13201-5 were calculated and compared. Average road surface luminance (Lav), overall uniformity of luminance (Uo), longitudinal uniformity (Ul), threshold increment (fTI), surround ratio (Rs) and average illuminance (E) values are within the lighting criteria provided in EN 13201-2 for M and C lighting classes. Minimum maintained horizontal illuminance (Eh), maintained horizontal illuminance (Emin) and threshold increment values are within the lighting criteria provided in EN 13201-2 for P lighting class. Illuminance values from the design using ReluxDesktop program match actual measurement values with acceptable discrepancies for all lighting classes.

This paper provides a scheme of discovering a brain connectivity using the Granger causality concept that is characterized on state-space models. A Granger inference matrix is implicitly derived from the state-space system matrices where its nonzero entries infer a directional dependence of the corresponding brain regions. Determining significant entries of a Granger matrix cannot be done in a straightforward way due to a lack of known statistical distribution of the inference measure. For this reason, we propose a scheme of clustering between significant and insignificant entries of a Granger matrix based on the use of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Our idea relies on the assumption of having a sufficient number of estimated Granger inference matrices and the use of central limit theorem to claim that the sample means of estimated Granger inference matrices converge to a Gaussian. As a result, the distribution of the vectorization of the sample mean matrices is similar to a mixture of Gaussians which can be clustered by the estimated posterior probabilities. Insignificant entries of Granger inference matrix is clustered to the Gaussian component with the lowest mean and then are inferred as no Granger causality. We illustrate the idea by simulation results based on several ground-truth Granger causality patterns derived from state-space equations."

It involves the injection of alkaline that can react with the petroleum acid to form an in-situ surfactant to reduce the interfacial tension between displacing and displaced phases and reduce the residual oil saturation, leading to the higher oil production. In Fang oilfield, Thailand, light oil production can be increased by using chemicals to reduce interfacial tension of oil and water. In this study, sodium carbonate is used as alkali to lower the interfacial tension with various conditions. Therefore, the objectives of this work are to measure the interfacial tension and to evaluate the effects of parameters such as concentration, pressure, temperature and salinity on interfacial tension reduction for oil from Thailand. The results present the effects of alkaline concentration on the interfacial tension. Also, the alkaline solution can reduce the interfacial tension significantly. Because, the alkaline can from the in-situ surfactant with the acid in oil to reduce the interfacial tension down to 0.6 mN/m. Temperature is also one of the parameters that affects the interfacial tension in the opposite direction. The increment of temperature would reduce the interfacial tension. The salinity has an effect on the interfacial tension in the same direction. The effects of these three parameters would reduce the interfacial tension. On the other hand, pressure has relatively less effect of IFT reduction. The results of this work can apply to increase more oil production for Fang oilfield with the optimum conditions."

Therefore, in this study, molecular sieves (MS) were introduced to adsorb the byproducts. The effect of different MS (3A and 5A) was studied. It was found that MS helped enhancing methanol yield. The highest methanol yield (42.8%) was obtained when adding MS_3A to adsorb water. The MS_5A could separate methanol and ethyl acetate, providing high methanol purity. The effect of operating conditions was also investigated. When reducing temperature to 130 \u00b0C, methanol yield decreased but methanol selectivity (>98%) significantly increased. Controlling temperature and using MS could help enhance the yield and selectivity of methanol."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Author(s).In this work, we use photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to investigate how self-assembled GaSb/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) depend on their growth mechanism. Carrier transfer (i.e., carrier recombination in QDs and escape through the barrier layer) is investigated as a function of excitation-power- and temperature-dependent PL measurements. A drastic blueshift of the QD peak energy from 1.23 to 1.30 eV and a further shift to 1.33 eV reveal the influence of the GaSb growth rate and the growth temperature on the optical properties of these QDs. The thermal activation energy is extracted from the temperature-dependent PL by fitting the integrated PL intensity of the QD peaks to the Arrhenius relation. The QDs grown at the growth rate of 0.1 monolayers/s at 450 \u00b0C have higher thermal activation energy (109 meV) than those grown at a lower growth rate and higher QD growth temperature. The observed PL characteristics are discussed in terms of QD size, uniformity of QDs, and material intermixing occurring during QD growth on the buffer layer and capping layer."

The effects of operating temperature, catalyst nickel loading and composition of O2-steam-CO2 feed gas on biochar carbon conversion and gas products were investigated. The results indicate that the highest biochar carbon conversion could be obtained at approximately 800 \u00b0C, whilst the 10% Ni/SiO2 catalyst was shown to produce the greatest syngas yields. The presence of O2 in the feed gas can result in slightly more CO in the gas product, whilst a higher steam content leads to more H2 in the gas product. The CO2 offered a benefit as an adjusting agent for achieving a desired H2/CO ratio. No evidence of coke deposition on the catalyst was found under any of the tested conditions."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 by the authors.Rooftop photovoltaics (PV) systems are attracting residential customers due to their renewable energy contribution to houses and to green cities. However, customers also need a comprehensive understanding of system design configuration and the related energy return from the system in order to support their PV investment. In this study, the rooftop PV systems from many high-volume installed PV systems countries and regions were collected to evaluate the lifetime energy yield of these systems based on machine learning techniques. Then, we obtained an association between the lifetime energy yield and technical configuration details of PV such as rated solar panel power, number of panels, rated inverter power, and number of inverters. Our findings reveal that the variability of PV lifetime energy is partly explained by the difference in PV system configuration. Indeed, our machine learning model can explain approximately 31% (95% confidence interval: 29-38%) of the variant energy efficiency of the PV system, given the configuration and components of the PV system. Our study has contributed useful knowledge to support the planning and design of a rooftop PV system such as PV financial modeling and PV investment decision."

This paper surveyed the presence of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs in aquaculture waters and demonstrated their removal by ferrate (Fe(VI), FeO42-). Tetracyclines were the most prevalent antibiotics, followed by quinolones and \u03b2-lactam. The bacterial resistance rates to three antibiotics were ordered as follows: amoxicillin (AMX) > oxytetracycline (OTC) > enrofloxacin (ENR). Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla, while sul1 and sul2 were the predominant ARGs. sul2 was positively correlated with Proteobacteria. Water quality parameters significantly influenced the dissemination of tetracycline resistance genes in aquacultures due to high organic waste accumulation. The removal efficiency of antibiotics by Fe(VI) depended on the structural moieties of antibiotics, with phenol-containing antibiotics more thoroughly oxidized (i.e., OTC) than amine-containing (ENR and AMX) antibiotics. Greater removal of antibiotics in aquaculture waters suggested that the constituents of farming water enhances the efficacy of antibiotics removal by Fe(VI). An acidic pH environment enhanced Fe(VI) inactivation of ARB over the circumneutral pH. The presented results are intended to improve aquaculture managing practices to minimize the antibiotic proliferation in aquaculture waters and the environment."

The alloys displayed the opaque state below 40 \u00b0C. The alloys were transformed to the transparent state upon exposing to the transition temperature of 60\u2013130 \u00b0C, depending on the molecular weights and mass concentrations of urethane prepolymers in the BA-a/PU alloys. The optical state transitions were reversible with small hystereses. BA-a/PU alloys exhibited a good optical contrast with 0%T at the light scattering state and almost 100%T at the transparent state. The alloys were glassy and form-stable up to 250 \u00b0C, due to the synergistic behavior in the glass transition temperatures. The reaction-induced phase separation effectuated by the incorporation of urethane prepolymer into thermosetting polybenzoxazine, the sizes and local concentrations of the phase-separated urethane microdomains in the supporting polybenzoxazine matrix, and the reversible dissolution and demixing of urethane microdomains and polybenzoxazine phase played crucial roles on TRLS properties of the developed benzoxazine-urethane alloys."

The research aims to study the feasibility in application of TiO2-nanoparticles coated on two commercially accessible FO membranes; an aquaporin (AqP) membrane and a cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane by the way of a specially designed 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate-polymethyl methacrylate-bromide (MEMO-PMMA-Br) monomer chain as a novel forward osmosis treatment method. High efficiency of reactive dye rejection of 99.9% could be achieved with this novel FO process with the use of 1 M NaCl as the draw solution, while varying reactive dye (black) at concentrations of 200, 400, 600, 800 ppm in the synthetic textile effluent. The obtained water fluxes of both FO membranes suggested that the achievement of the CTA membrane was incredibly improved after surface modification than that of AqP membrane with the increase in average fluxes of 18.03% and 11.83%, respectively. The experiments also suggested that CTA membrane gives higher water flux than aquaporin membrane for forward osmosis filtration for synthetic textile effluent. Moreover, effect of interferences in terms of dissolved anions on reactive dye removal efficiencies by the TiO2-nanoparticles coated FO membranes were also investigated."

The degree of Lewis acid transformation on WO3/SiO2 was higher than on WO3/Al2O3 because the weaker interaction between WO3 and SiO2 showed higher hydrogen accessibility as revealed by the H2-TPR and H2-TPD results. Moreover, Pt co-catalyst with supported tungsten oxide catalyst could enhance hydrogen uptake on WO3 catalyst, leading to higher Lewis acid transformation. However, the investigation of surface WO3 structures were observed by XRD, FT-Raman, UV\u2013vis, and TEM to be the key point for allowing the Lewis acid transformation. After Lewis acid transformation, isolated tetrahedral WO3 were stable whereas octahedral polytungstate and crystalline WO3 decreased, converting to W4+ and W5+. The decreasing of crystalline WO3 after Lewis acid transformation was also found to be correlated well with the hydrogen uptake. Therefore, Lewis acid transformation on supported WO3 preferentially occurred on crystalline WO3 than on octahedral polytungstate WO3 and isolated tetrahedral WO3, respectively."

The unique method involves a single-step pyrolysis process in an air atmosphere, eliminating the need for an inert atmosphere and pre-treatment procedures. It enables simultaneous self-templating and heteroatom doping, resulting in oxygen-rich functional groups embedded in the nitrogen-doped carbon structure. We also crafted a carbon structure without heteroatom doping, comparing its electrochemical performance in ORR and HER. Our findings indicate that carbon catalysts pyrolyzed at higher temperatures have more pyridinic N, functional groups, and active sites- factors conducive to electrochemical reactions. We tested the air-synthesized electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline electrolyte and employed the optimized nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, pyrolyzed at 700 \u00b0C in an air atmosphere, as cathode material in a zinc-air battery. This catalyst demonstrated ORR performance comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst and showed minimal overpotential in acidic HER.

As a reference; CsI:Tl crystal was also grown in the identical growth system. The crystal growth was processed under argon atmosphere in a quartz crucible. The composition of dopant was kept a constant of 0.35%wt. X-ray diffraction measurements show that CsI:Tl and CsI(Tl,Ca) crystals have the cubic crystal structure with a dominant (110) plane. But CsI:Ca crystal has two dominant planes of (110) and (211). In addition, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to investigate their optical properties: CsI:Ca and CsI(Tl,Ca) crystals emitted the blue light in a range of 420-450 nm wavelength with two dominant peaks but the orange light emission of 590-nm wavelength from CsI:Tl crystal. To evaluate the efficiency and energy resolution of radiation detection by coupling these CsI scintillators with a photomultiplier tube, the results reveal their different radiation performances due to the main difference in their optical properties about the light emission characteristics. In conclusion, the radiation performance of CsI:Ca scintillator has been still challenge to accomplish with the optimized growth condition and the suitable coupling devices."

The performance of the hybrid adsorbent was quantified with respect to metal ions removal and its regeneration capability. The results show that equilibrium adsorption of Cd2+ can be achieved within 30 min, whereas removing Cu2+ and Zn2+ requires 1 h of exposure. The adsorption capacity is found to depend on the metal ion, with Cu2+ > Cd2+ >> Zn2+. It was found that the solution pH affects performance: stronger adsorption was observed at neutral than at acidic pH.

As there are many applications in the same category and the competition is very high in the market, mobile development teams need to get user feedback on their applications so that they can improve quality of the applications. An important source of feedback is user review on App Store and Play Store from which the developers can analyze problems and recommendations for future maintenance and evolution of the applications. Since there might be a large number of user reviews for each release of a mobile application, this paper proposes an automated approach to classifying user reviews as bug reports or feature requests. These classification results are used as a basis for generating tickets for an issue tracking system, i.e. Jira. In user review classification, text classification, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and review metadata are used with several machine learning algorithms, i.e. Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, LinearSVC, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble methods. The best classifiers for both categories of reviews are used further in an implementation of a Jira ticket generating tool. The tool considers semantic similarity of review comments and can filter out duplicate user reviews. When necessary, the tool applies text summarization to the user review to extract the title of a ticket for the corresponding bug report or feature request. The approach can facilitate the mobile development team in their maintenance task as the developers can pick the tickets and work on them to improve the application in a future release."

When the reaction volume was increased from 165 to 500 and 1000 mL with constant power input (80 W), homogenizer reactor did not significantly alter the rate of fatty acid methyl ester formation, unlike the other reactors which showed the decrease in the reaction rate. The reactor performance was evaluated in term of yield efficiency which was based on the amount of fatty acid methyl ester production, power consumption and reaction time. The increase of the reaction volume increased the yield efficiency of both the cavitation reactors and the mechanical stirred reactor.

Post aluminized samples were characterized by glancing incident-angle X-ray diffractometer (GIXD). Quantitative analysis of the layer was performed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the resulting microstructure.

        "Title": "Relation extraction between bacteria and biotopes from biomedical texts with attention mechanisms and domain-specific contextual representations",
        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: The Bacteria Biotope (BB) task is a biomedical relation extraction (RE) that aims to study the interaction between bacteria and their locations. This task is considered to pertain to fundamental knowledge in applied microbiology. Some previous investigations conducted the study by applying feature-based models; others have presented deep-learning-based models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks used with the shortest dependency paths (SDPs). Although SDPs contain valuable and concise information, some parts of crucial information that is required to define bacterial location relationships are often neglected. Moreover, the traditional word-embedding used in previous studies may suffer from word ambiguation across linguistic contexts. Results: Here, we present a deep learning model for biomedical RE. The model incorporates feature combinations of SDPs and full sentences with various attention mechanisms. We also used pre-trained contextual representations based on domain-specific vocabularies. To assess the model's robustness, we introduced a mean F1 score on many models using different random seeds. The experiments were conducted on the standard BB corpus in BioNLP-ST'16. Our experimental results revealed that the model performed better (in terms of both maximum and average F1 scores; 60.77% and 57.63%, respectively) compared with other existing models. Conclusions: We demonstrated that our proposed contributions to this task can be used to extract rich lexical, syntactic, and semantic features that effectively boost the model's performance. Moreover, we analyzed the trade-off between precision and recall to choose the proper cut-off to use in real-world applications."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.Current method for identification of foodborne pathogens suffers from its relatively poor performance, consequently limiting its use. Herein, we first describe an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor based on nitrogen-decorated carbon dots (NCDs) for Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) determination using a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Citric acid serves as carbon source, and ethylenediamine, a molecule containing nitrogen atom, is employed to synthesize CDs. Approximately 4 nm NCD with homogenous size distribution can be produced via a single step green microwave-assisted methodology. The construction of ECL sensor is initiated by the immobilization of capture antibody (Ab1) onto the carboxyl graphene (GOOH)-modified SPCE, where immunocomplexes (antigen and the NCD-labelled secondary antibody (Ab2-NCD)) are formed, resulting in a substantial increment in the ECL signal response in the presence of K2S2O8. The GOOH allows direct formation of the capture antibodies and enhances the electrochemical properties. Under optimal parameters, this sensor exhibits wide linearity (2 to 1.0 \u00d7 106 CFU mL\u22121), high sensitivity (0.104 or 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121 CFU mL\u22121) and specificity over the nontargeting studied pathogens and is successfully applied to determine L. monocytogenes in food products. These promising results together with its performance suggest that this proposed platform may serve as an alternative device to effectively control the spread of foodborne diseases."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural design of inter-services collaborations. In general, SOA has three major roles, including client, service provider, and service broker. To access a service usually depends on a service broker, which causes inflexibility in system modification. The software industry now focuses more on productivity, flexibility of the constant changes and continuous modifications, for which the SOA style may not be suitable. Therefore, a new microservice style is an alternative serving those needs, which means a microservice unit is more adaptable and replaceable with no ripple effects. Since the microservice architecture design is considered as a collection of the small self-contained services, each service represents a business capability and carries its own isolated data. However, how to identify microservices is still a challenging task in the business process model level. This paper proposes an alternative mean to extract the existing SOA services from the BPEL flow and refactor them into a set of relevant microservices using the decomposition pattern. In our case study, we propose how to do the service refactoring against the business domain profiles collected from the extracted vocabularies from the given business scenarios. The resulting microservices are domain specific and conform to the business capability vocabularies extracted from the given business scenarios."

However, silicate-based glass fibers have low alkali resistance especially in cement matrix composite. In this work, we studied the improvement of alkali resistance by addition of zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4) in original basalt glass composition. The batch of basalt glass with additional ZrSiO4 contents of 0.00, 2.50, 5.00, 7.50 and 10.00 wt% were melted at 1500 \u00b0C. The liquidus temperature (TL) is important in for the fiber glass manufacturing. It need to formulate glass composition which requires a lower melting temperature and is crystallization resistant. TL as a function of composition is usually determined experimentally. In this study, glassy phase was determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The glass transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tc) and TL were analyzed by Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). The results found that the addition of ZrSiO4 in a basalt glass batch increased Tg while Tc of each sample was closed to original basalt fiber. Moreover, the alkali resistance of these glasses increased with an increasing of ZrSiO4 content. However, excessive ZrSiO4 contents (7.50 and 10.00 wt%) resulted in crystallization of ZrO2 which separated from glassy phase."

The use of a fractional open-circuit voltage method with feedback mechanism make the MPPT highly robust against process variation and component tolerances. Moreover, due to an input capacitor-less feature, the MPPT circuit can fast track the maximum power point (MPP) when input voltage varies.

The 50 MVA oil-immersed power transformer was investigated with field measurement data at Navanakorn4 substation in Pathum Thani. The results showed load level, harmonic current and ambient temperature are the factors which have impacts on transformer by increasing the hottest-spot temperature. The transformer life when increases the level of these factors is analyzed. When transformer supplies only linear loads, its life does not reduce from specification although load level and ambient temperature are increased. For the case of transformer supplies nonlinear load, harmonic current increases load level and transformer losses. Therefore, transformer life can be reduced when increasing the level of load, harmonic current and the ambient temperature."

IET Renewable Power Generation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Institution of Engineering and TechnologyAt present, high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems on low voltage (LV) distribution systems is increasing worldwide because of several favourable conditions, such as government policies, decreasing cost of PV technologies, and environmental awareness. However, varying sunlight and three-phase unbalanced load conditions can result in voltage violation, especially an overvoltage problem, and voltage unbalanced conditions that deteriorate the power quality. Therefore, disconnection of PV systems, especially on the downstream node, can occur due to the overvoltage protection of the PV system, which results in PV owners losing revenue from selling electricity. Moreover, some electrical appliances can be damaged from voltage unbalanced conditions. To support a high PV penetration and prevent these adverse impacts, this study applies a control strategy involving coordination between the Central Control Unit (CCU) and Local Control Functions (LCFs) of PV systems. The CCU applies the Adaptive Tabu Search (ATS) technique to search for the optimal LCF parameter setting of PV systems and adjusted this weekly. The optimization problem is the maximization of real power generation from all PV systems under varying (uncertain) sunlight and three-phase unbalanced loads. MATLAB programming is used for the Newton\u2013Raphson power flow simulation on a modified 19-node distribution system."

The effects of the reduction methods on their properties were investigated. The chitosan-reduced composite exhibited dispersed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) within the nanocellulose matrix with the smallest size, while the ascorbic-reduced composite displayed the largest size. The incorporation of AgNPs tended to reduce the crystallinity of the composites, except for the ascorbic-reduced composite, which exhibited an increase in crystallinity. Mechanical testing revealed that the ascorbic-reduced composite had the highest Young\u2019s modulus of 8960 MPa, whereas the UV-reduced composite had the highest tensile strength and elongation at break. Thermal analysis of BC-Ag composites indicated similar glass transition temperature and decomposition profiles to BC, with additional weight-loss steps at high temperatures.

Water absorption capacity was reduced by the incorporation of AgNPs, except for the chitosan-reduced composite, which showed an enhanced water absorption capacity of 344%.

Among those algorithms to classify time series data, shapelet \u2013 a discriminative subsequence of time series data \u2013 is considered a practical approach due to its accurate and insightful classification. However, previously proposed shapelet algorithms still suffer from exceedingly high computational complexity, as a result, limiting its scalability to larger datasets.

Empirical experiments on forty datasets evidently demonstrate that our proposed work could achieve large speedup while maintaining its accuracy.

As a result, our DIS algorithm could achieve more than three orders of magnitude speedup, comparing with the baseline algorithms, while preserving the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithm."

Overbooking allows an incoming booking to be accepted in exceedance of an available capacity because it is believed that some booking will be cancelled later. It is a complicated and risky decision since the decision maker needs to minimize both outsourcing cost and opportunity-lost cost simultaneously. When there are two classes of resources, it is not necessary to always outsource the insufficient and Iow-priced resources. Upgrading customers to high-priced resources is possible. The objective of this research is to develop overbooking models for (1) one class of resources and (2) two classes of resources (ie, high and low price) to minimize total cost i. e., opportunity cost, cost of upgrading and outsource cost).

This paper aims to classify active and inactive sources from the information that can be inferred from parameters of a dynamical model that captures characteristics of EEG time series. We propose a state-space model for explaining coupled dynamics of the source and EEG signals where EEG is a linear combination of sources according to the characteristics of volume conduction. Our model has a structure that the sparsity pattern of the model output matrix can indicate the position of active and inactive sources. With this assumption, the proposed estimation method consists of two steps. Firstly, a subspace identification method is performed to estimate the dynamic matrix of the model and the mapping matrix from the state variable to EEG output. Secondly, the estimation of the output matrix in the state-space model from the mapping matrix is solved by a group lasso problem to promote a sparsity pattern. As a result, nonzero rows of the output matrix represent active source that corresponding to EEG data. We verify the performance of our method on randomly generated data sets that represent realistic human brain activities in a fair setting. An acceptable accuracy of 95 - 98% is obtained with a suitable selection of a problem parameter and a thresholding process to discard small magnitudes of the output matrix."

The main sources of CO2 come from industries such as power generation. The current technology to remove CO2 effectively is carbon capture and storage or CCS especially absorption with aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solutions are monoethanolamine (MEA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). They have some disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. A new solvent such as 3-amino-1-propanol (AP) has been designed to be used as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal. This solvent should provide the absorption and cyclic capacities close or higher than the commercial ones. The objective of this research is to measure the CO2 absorption in a 4 M aqueous solution of AP at the temperature from 303.15 K to 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa and the absorption results of CO2 in AP solution are compared with that of aqueous solution of MEA. From the experiment, the results present that AP at 4 M provides the performance relatively close to that of MEA. The cyclic capacities of AP are relatively lower than that of MEA for 26.83 and 2.73 % for CO2 partial pressure at 15 and 100 kPa. The absorption capacity of AP is higher when CO2 partial pressure increases and reduces as temperature increases. AP can be considered as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal at high CO2 partial pressure. Other properties like kinetics, mass transfer, energy penalty for solvent regeneration as well as other criteria have to be investigated for AP before it can be used for commercial purposes."

In this work, methyl palmitate (palmitic acid methyl ester) having a melting point around 30\u2103, was used as a model solid non-particulate (waxy) soil. A total surfactant concentration of 0.35 wt% of the selected formulation (4:0.65 weight ratio of C12,13-4PO-SO4Na:SMDNS) with 5.3 wt% NaCl was able to form a middle phase microemulsion at a high temperature (40\u2103),which provided the highest oil removal level with the lowest oil redeposition and the lowest IFT, and was much higher than that with a commercial detergent or de-ionized water. Most of the detached oil, whether in liquid or solid state, was in an unsolubilized form. Hence, the dispersion stability of the detached oil droplets or solidified oil particles that resulted from the surfactant adsorption played an important role in the oil redeposition. For an oily detergency, the lower the system IFT, the higher the oil removal whereas for a waxy (non-particulate) soil detergency, the lower the contact angle, the higher the solidified oil removal. For a liquefied oil, the detergency mechanism was roll up and emulsification with dispersion stability, while that for the waxy soil (solid oil) was the detachment by wettability with dispersion stability."

For the synthesis of activated carbon catalysts, coffee ground residues were chemical activated with ZnCl2 (ratio 1:3) followed by different physical activation. All prepared catalysts were characterized with various techniques such as nitrogen physisorption (BET and BJH methods), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The dehydrogenation of vaporized ethanol was performed to test the catalytic activity and product distribution. Testing catalytic activity by operated in a fixed-bed continuous flow micro-reactor at temperatures ranged from 250 to 400 \u00b0C. It was found that the AC-D catalyst (using calcination under carbon dioxide flow at 600 \u00b0C, 4 hours for physical activation) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while all catalysts show high selectivity to acetaldehyde (more than 90%). Ethanol conversion apparently increased with increased reaction temperature. At 400 \u00baC, the AC-D catalyst gave the highest ethanol conversion of 47.9% and yielded 46.8% of acetaldehyde. The highest activity obtained from AC-D catalyst can be related to both Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity because the dehydrogenation of ethanol uses both Lewis acid and Lewis basic sites for this reaction. To investigate the stability of catalyst, the AC-D catalyst showed quite constant ethanol conversion for 10 h. Therefore, the synthesized activated carbon from coffee ground residues is promising to be used in dehydrogenation of ethanol."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2023 Scientific Association for Infocommunications. All rights reserved.With the constant increase in public transit coverage in Bangkok Metropolitan Area in Thailand, many people are still hesitant to switch from using private to public transit, with one potential cause being the unavailability and difficulty in accessing accurate and timely information about their itineraries, while they are commuting. To assess and tackle such issues, the researchers adopted the user-centric Design Thinking methodology to empathize with target users' pain points in this study. They proposed a solution in a user-centric manner by assessing the usability flaws of existing mobile navigation applications, such as Google Maps and ViaBus. By developing a holistic mobile application called 'Disgovery' that covers all modes of public transit in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and provides relevant information about their trips, the researchers aim to help commuters in Bangkok easily access it in a timely fashion. Through the user-friendly interface, commuters can eliminate the difficulty of finding routes and prices suitable to their needs. By making public transit more accessible with the help of ubiquitous mobile computing, commuters are also encouraged to switch from using private vehicles to public transit, which also can reduce accidents and carbon emissions. The findings from the usability testing in this study suggest that 'Disgovery' is an effective and user-friendly application for daily commuters in Bangkok that can help them achieve their goals without difficulties. The findings also indicate the importance of user interface and user experience guidelines in designing such applications."

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020 22nd Congress of the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research-Asia Pacific Division, IAHR-APD 2020: \"Creating Resilience to Water-Related Challenges\". All rights reserved.This research studies the land use dynamics and its effects on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships in Yom river basin of Thailand. The study compares land use land coverage change (LULCC), rainfall-runoff pattern, and sediment load in the main river course from 1980s to 1990s and to 2014. A land use map updated from different periods (Land Development Department, Thailand) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imageries have been carried out as inputs for land use change coverage analysis. Double mass curve with trend curve analysis is employed to evaluate the effects of LULCC on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment yield relationships. The results indicate that from 1990 to 2014, many forests in Yom river basin have been significantly transformed into farmland and irrigation area, especially in high-slope locations relatively further away from the main river course. This change of land use pattern has consecutively altered the rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships, and lead to more pronounced slope of trend curve (STC) of annual rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment mass curves in 1990s compared to 2000s, implying that more soil and water loss yield in 2000s. One can logically suggest that the runoff-sediment load obtained during 1990s is higher than 2000s with similar rainfall/runoff, which can further be explained by the historic landuse dynamics. With the new water allocation scheme for flood risk reduction in the lower Chaophraya river basin, agricultural practices have spatio-temporally changed and parts of Yom river basin have been used for flood retention areas, significant alteration in rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment patterns has been observed (i.e., in Bangrakam and Kongkrailart Districts). Continuous reduction of forest fraction results in soil loss, landslide, river bank erosion, and flood occurrence results in a more degrading river water quality and potential decrease in river capacity for flood protection, all involved stakeholder such as local authorities, communities, farmers, and policy makers should pay attention to apply appropriate land use and watershed management and flood risk reduction practices."

The liver lobules are treated as porous media in hexagonal shapes connected as a lattice where the flux of ascitic fluid is measured at its border. The influence of size of sinusoids, interstitial space, and fenestrated wall on ascites volume is investigated. Sinusoidal obstruction has the most effect on ascites production compared to the others. Moreover, since each liver disease has different character of pore obstruction, we investigated the effect of location of sinusoidal obstruction on ascites production. The generalized occlusion has more effect on ascites than pericentral and periportal occlusion, respectively, which is correlated to clinical findings in each hepatic disease. The measured flux of ascitic fluid is found linearly related to hepatic wedge pressure (Pw) and free hepatic pressure (Pf). From these results we conclude that increasing of either Pw or Pf can increase production of ascitic fluid."

In order to meet this criteria, main objectives that composed of three aspects which are environment, economic, and social has to be completely met. Practically, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is one of a useful tools that can promote the sustainable development effectively in which decent amount of renown companies in Thailand operate and find it quite successful for some degrees. For this study, the goal was to investigate the current situation of renewable energy for a community project in Thailand. The biogas production from swine farms was used as the representative case study to evaluate the economic, environmental and social performance. The key performance indicators (KPI) were used which based on the ISO 2600:2010. The study revealed that the project provided the returns rate on the investment to the public in the form of \"Social return on investment\" (SROI) to be 6.59 which indicated that the CSR project is worth for the investment. In addition, the net present value (NPV) could also promote the benefits in term of economic for about 3,038,137 THB per year. For the environmental perspective, the biogas from swine farm can cause the reduction in energy/fuel consumption along with the utilization of treated waste sludge as a fertilizer which also gain the carbon credits from GHG emission mitigation. As for the social perspective, the benefit gains were in the form of monetary along with the increasing of employment rate which resulted from the CSR biogas production projects were used to calculate for the economic perspective as the direct economic value which accounted for over 389,149 THB per year. The results of this study can be a useful case study for project owners or related sectors to make the improvement and moving toward the sustainable development later on."

Modeling of the integrated process is performed by using the Aspen Custom Modeler program. The simulation results show that the production rates of synthesis gas and bio-oil derived from an IBPG process increase as pyrolysis temperature increases, due to the increased volatiles. Compared to a conventional biomass gasification, IBPG provides additional bio-oil as a valued by-product, releases less waste heat and offers higher energy efficiency at the same synthesis gas production rate. The IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 700 \u00b0C shows the best technical performance. However, pinch analysis indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 400 \u00b0C or 500 \u00b0C and conventional biomass gasification is technically feasible; the optimum heat integration structures are achieved. The economic analysis, which considers only the reaction-related equipment, indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 500 \u00b0C offers synthesis gas and bio-oil production rates of 1.185 and 0.2044 kmol h\u22121, respectively, and an energy efficiency of 68.86% is most economically feasible."

Nonetheless, recently developed ZIBs still suffer from low cycling stability and high capacity fading. Such shortcomings are caused by the reversibility of both zinc (Zn) and the cathode host material, as well as hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, which are naturally protic solvents. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a polar aprotic solvent, is examined as an electrolyte for a ZIB. Zn stripping/plating in DMSO-based electrolytes shows excellent reversibility and dendrite-free morphology. During charging and resting modes, hydrogen evolution is effectively inhibited. Insertion/extraction of Zn ions in DMSO-based electrolytes into delta-type manganese dioxide (\u03b4-MnO2) demonstrates high stability, achieving a decent initial capacity of 159 mAh/g at 50 mA/g and a nominal discharge voltage of 1.15 V. At 100 mA/g charge/discharge cycling, the ZIB, having the DMSO-based electrolyte, can pass 1000 cycles, displaying a capacity retention of 60%. Overall, the improved performance of ZIBs can be attained using DMSO-based electrolytes. Results pave the way towards the practical application of ZIBs."

It was the first vote in the last five years since the seizure of power by the military coup leaded by General Prayut Chan-o-cha. A social media has become a part of daily life with a real time message distribution including sharing an opinion in politics. Twitter becomes the most widely used tool for creating trends by political parties and politicians. In this paper, we propose an analysis of election result according to data analysis from Twitter and Election Commission of Thailand (ECT). We used Twitter Advanced Search to collect data within three months from January 1 to March 31, 2019. We found the top keywords and hashtags trended on Twitter as the Future Forward Party (FFP). Meanwhile, the winner of the popular vote was the Palang Pracharat Party. We found no correlation between the number of retweets and votes as only one party got the outstanding number of retweets. From the analysis of retweeters\u2019 accounts, the characteristics of retweeters of the Future Forward Party differed from the retweeters of other parties. We then refined the analysis based on the sentiment of messages mentioning the political parties tweeted by the retweeters. The correlation coefficient between the number of positive mentions and votes became 0.615 with the removal of the FFP from the analysis. In addition, we found that the number of messages with a specific political party mentioned might reflect the election results. Finally, the TF-IDF analysis of words from the tweet messages during the campaign showed that words delivered by each party had different contextual meanings such as paying attention to people, party\u2019s policy, complaint, and blame."

Loop optimizations have been considered at low-level phase, such as loop unrolling using compiler directive. For high-level code transformations such as index set splitting and loop reordering, we adopt the polyhedral model to simplify the transformations. In this study, our loop optimization has been evaluated quantitatively. We study the impact on loops execution speed up and its instruction executed. Our observation shows that high-level loop optimizations can reduce both execution time and the number of instruction. This behavior suggested that simple loop transformations can trigger other optimizations. Moreover, we not only improve the overall performance, but also reduce the number of instruction. The results show that loop optimizations yield the speed up between 1.5 and 1.7."

The traditional classification by humans is time consuming and possibly error prone if the inspection is not performed by titanium microstructure experts. Deep learning is considered the revolution of computer vision to enable computers to see and perceive like humans. The technique is widely used for automatically classifying images with high accuracy. In order to reduce human inspection time during quality control, this research presents the use of a type of deep learning, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks, for pixel-wise classification in the titanium microstructure images. The dataset contains private images of titanium samples taken by SEM microscopes. As the available training dataset is small, data augmentation using elastic deformations is applied for increasing the accuracy of the model.

The influence of one-step and two-step coating methods on the performance of modified Fe3O4NP was investigated. The PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP with a narrow particle size distribution obtained from the two-step approach were highly stable in aqueous media within a wide range of pH. The particles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior with high saturation magnetization values so that they could be easily separated from solution by a magnet. Their antifouling characteristics against 2 selected proteins, lysozyme (LYZ) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), as a function of copolymer molecular weight and composition were also evaluated. Moreover, taking advantage of having carboxyl groups in the coated copolymer, the PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP were conjugated with a model biomolecular probe, biotin. The biotin-immobilized PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP were then tested for their specific capturing of a target molecule, streptavidin. The results have demonstrated the potential of PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP prepared by the two-step in situ coating method for probe immobilization and subsequent biomagnetic separation of target molecules. The fact that the developed functionalizable magnetite nanoparticles are biocompatible and antifouling also opens up the possibility of their use in other biomedical-relevant applications."
