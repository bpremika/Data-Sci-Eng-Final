"An ontology-based knowledge acquisition for PDM © 2018 IEEE.In the present, there are numerous project management software packages used to serve the complex scheduling tasks in a project plan including different groups of people and resources. Most of the tools apply Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) to visualize the activities and their dependencies among various project activities but these tools do not provide semantic representation. Thus, it still requires an implicit knowledge of project managers to analyze and manage scheduling tasks. Ontology could be used to represent the structure of a domain by means of defining concepts and properties that relate them. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for building PDM ontology using OWL and construct SWRL reasoning to infer new knowledge from existing one.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Preferential nucleation, guiding, and blocking of self-propelled droplets by dislocations © 2018 Author(s).Lattice-mismatched layers of GaAs/InGaAs are grown on GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy and subsequently heated in vacuum while the surface is imaged in situ using low-energy electron microscopy, in order to study (i) the nucleation of group-III droplets formed as a result of noncongruent sublimation and (ii) the dynamics of these self-propelled droplets as they navigate the surface. It is found that the interfacial misfit dislocation network not only influences the nucleation sites of droplets, but also exerts unusual steering power over their subsequent motion. Atypical droplet flow patterns including 90° and 180° turns are found. The directions of these dislocations-guided droplets are qualitatively explained in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane stress fields associated with the buried dislocations and the driving forces due to chemical potential and stress gradients typical of Marangoni flow. The findings would benefit processes and devices that employ droplets as catalysts or active structures such as droplet epitaxy of quantum nanostructures, vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires, or the fabrication of self-integrated circuits.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"An Accuracy and Repeatability of a Robot made with V-Slot Extrusion with built-in Linear Rails © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Recently, aluminum extrusion with a built-in V-rail linear bearing draws increasing attention, especially among the hobbyist and makers, and is applied into many of their projects. The aluminum extrusion is an open source, light weight, and coming with extensive accessory. This significantly reduces cost and gives flexibility to their projects. Its performance is reasonable and adequate for operations among hobbyist and university's projects. However, the precise accuracy of this kind of robot is usually unavailable. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyse performance of the V-Slot extrusion with built-in linear rails robot in terms of accuracy and repeatability. The tools, in this investigation, can be obtained within the ecosystem and the process can be done by the user. This performance result will help general users to define the scope of the operation that can be achieved with reasonable result when using this robot. The methodology, in this experiment, is Trajectory analysis approach that commands the robot to move in both linear and circular, with various travel distances, in a single run, and determine the defects.

"Monitoring of Surface Roughness in Aluminium Turning Process © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.As the turning process is one of the most necessary process. The surface roughness has been considered for the quality of workpiece. There are many factors which affect the surface roughness. Hence, the objective of this research is to monitor the relation between the surface roughness and the cutting forces in aluminium turning process with a wide range of cutting conditions. The coated carbide tool and aluminium alloy (Al 6063) are used for this experiment. The cutting parameters are investigated to analyze the effects of them on the surface roughness which are the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius and the depth of cut. In the case of this research, the dynamometer is installed in the turret of CNC turning machine to generate a signal while turning. The relation between dynamic cutting forces and the surface roughness profile is examined by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The experimentally obtained results showed that the cutting force depends on the cutting condition. The surface roughness can be improved when increasing the cutting speed and the tool nose radius in contrast to the feed rate and the depth of cut. The relation between the cutting parameters and the surface roughness can be explained by the in-process cutting forces.

"Assessment of heat-to-power ratio in a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell system © 2019 Elsevier LtdA solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (Uf), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in Uf decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"Performance comparison among different multifunctional reactors operated under energy self-sufficiency for sustainable hydrogen production from ethanol © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCFour ethanol-derived hydrogen production processes including conventional ethanol steam reforming (ESR), sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR), chemical looping reforming (CLR) and sorption enhanced chemical looping reforming (SECLR) were simulated on the basis of energy self-sufficiency, i.e. process energy requirement supplied by burning some of the produced hydrogen. The process performances in terms of hydrogen productivity, hydrogen purity, ethanol conversion, CO2 capture ability and thermal efficiency were compared at their maximized net hydrogen. The simulation results showed that the sorption enhanced processes yield better performances than the conventional ESR and CLR because their in situ CO2 sorption increases hydrogen production and provides heat from the sorption reaction. SECLR is the most promising process as it offers the highest net hydrogen with high-purity hydrogen at low energy requirement. Only 12.5% of the produced hydrogen was diverted into combustion to fulfill the process's energy requirement.

"Surface-Dependence of Adsorption and Its Influence on Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Reaction: A Case of Photocatalytic Degradation of Linuron on Zinc Oxide © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: This work systematically investigates a discrepancy in photocatalytic degradation pathway observed even when same kind of photocatalyst is used. This issue is particularly important for the degradation of toxic compound because the shifting in the pathway may result in intermediates having increased toxicity. Linuron, which is a toxic herbicide, is used as a model compound and zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as a catalyst. Two forms of ZnO having different exposing surfaces, i.e., conventional particles and nanorods are considered. It is experimentally shown and confirmed by molecular simulation that the adsorption and subsequent degradation are surface dependent. The adsorption capacity of linuron on polar surfaces of ZnO is much higher than that on non-polar surface. More importantly, alignments of linuron molecule adsorbing on different surfaces are different, leading to formation of different degradation intermediates. The degradation takes place on both aliphatic and aromatic sides when linuron adsorbs on polar surfaces whereas only the aliphatic part is attacked by hydroxyl radicals on the non-polar mixed terminated surface. The results in this work indicate that the exposing surface of the photocatalyst is the key factor in determining the degradation pathway and it should be considered in the catalyst design.

The building model has two rooms equipped with air-conditioning (AC) system where they contain heat interactions with walking path and the outdoor. Only one-dimensional heat transfer and internal energy change have been concerned while neglecting the effects caused by humidity and air leakage. Cooling energy from the AC system is expressed via the coefficient of performance (COP) and is a nonlinear function of room temperatures. We propose an approximate linear model with an assumption that the COP is a constant obtained by the air-conditioner specifications or it can be estimated.

Numerical investigation of Au-silane functionalised optical fibre sensor for volatile organic compounds biomarker (VOCs) detection © 2021 SPIE.A numerical modelling to theoretically investigate and analyse the characteristic of the surface functionalised optical fibre based sensor to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) biomarker is introduced in this paper. A 125-micron diameter of coreless silica fibre (CSF) connected to single-mode fibre (SMF) at both ends to achieve a structure of SMF-CSF-SMG is proposed to detect VOCs biomarkers for diabetes such as acetone and isopropanol. The coreless fibre region is considered to be a sensing region where the multimode interference (MMI) occurs having a higher light interaction at the interface between the fibre and sensing medium which leads to the enhancement of sensitivity. The sensing region undergoes surface functionalisation with Au-silane for the sensor to be selectively detect VOCs biomarker with electrostatic absorption. The length of the sensing region is numerically optimised to achieve a reimaging distance where the highest possible of coupling efficiency occurs and the maximum output signal can be obtained. Coupling efficiency spectra at different volume fractions of gold nanoparticles with various acetone and isopropanol concentrations are also presented. A sensitivity of the Au-silane functionalised optical fibre sensor is achieved by using the analysis of wavelength shift interrogation. The results show the spectra undergoes red-shift phenomenon in the near-infrared region (NIR) when concentrations of acetone and isopropanol are increased. The functionalisation of Au-silane on the optical fibre sensor provides a higher sensitivity compared to the unfunctionalised sensor as it shows more dramatic shifts of absorption spectra when there is a change in VOCs biomarker concentration.,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
