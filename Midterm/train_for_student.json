        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellulose (BC-AC) was modified with various amounts of H3PO4(x wt% P/BC-AC) and used as a catalyst for the selective dehydration of ethanol to ethylene. The BC-AC obtained at a carbonization temperature of 500 \u00b0C had a mesoporous structure with surface area and total pore volume of ~1730 m2/g and 1.0 cm3/g, respectively. An increase in the H3PO4 loading from 5% to 40% increased the number of weak acid sites on the catalyst surface, which consequently enhanced ethanol conversion. At the reaction temperature of 400 \u00b0C, the modified BC-AC with 30-40 wt% H3PO4 loading (P/BC-AC) gave an ethanol conversion at 100% and an ethylene selectivity of 100%. A high selectivity for diethyl ether (DEE) at ~ 67% at ethanol conversion of ~ 50% was obtained at 200 \u00b0C. Stability tests with a time-on-stream of 12 h, at reaction temperatures of 200 and 400 \u00b0C, showed that the P/BC-AC catalyst had high thermal stability and stable catalytic activity. Therefore, P/BC-AC was found to be very effective as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly catalyst for ethylene production via ethanol dehydration.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Residue number system (RNS) is a number representation system that represents a large integer with several smaller integers. Due to its ability to perform addition and multiplication in parallel, RNS is widely used in signal processing, communication, and cryptography. To extend the ability of RNS, redundant residue number system (RRNS), which has abilities to detect and correct errors, is proposed to be used in fault tolerant applications. Currently, there are two major ways to construct RRNS from RNS. This paper proposes an alternative way to do the construction by using redundant residue representations. Our proposed RRNS can perform certain operations more efficiently, for example, backward conversion and error detection, and can also perform a complex RNS operation, namely, comparing the values between two RRNS representations. However, it would have more costs to perform addition and multiplication on our RRNS. We also compare our work to the two previous works, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Further investigations are required to improve the performance of the proposed RRNS.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In petroleum industries, waxy crude oil is normally found in petroleum production. Wax formation and precipitation during pipeline transport of waxy crude oils can cause several challenges, including wax deposition and flow reduction which adversely impacts pipeline performance in oil and gas production. To overcome the wax deposition problem, the small amount of chemicals like wax inhibitors can provide an effective preventative measure. One of this mechanism is to reduce the pour point temperature. In this work, oil from Sirikit Oilfield in Thailand is selected for this study. The wax inhibitors are selected and studied the performance for pour-point reduction. These chemicals are Polyalkyl methacrylate (PAMA), Poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecane) (PMAO), Polyalkyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol (PAMAEG) and Copolymers of maleic anhydride (CPMA) with the concentration ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm. Also, n-pentane with the concentration of 5-20 % by weight is used as a solvent for wax inhibitors. The results from this study show that n-pentane can reduce the pour point to 39.41 % compared to the original oil. Furthermore, among the polymer group, PMAO can reduce the lowest pour point to 52.82 %. In addition, the mixed solvents of polymer with n-pentane can provide relatively less effect on pour-point reduction. The mixture of n-pentane with PMAO can lower the pour point to a certain level of 54.96 % compared to the original oil. This study can be applied to use in the real field to prevent wax deposition in the pipeline transportation for oil production.",

However, the DR of a particular system strongly depends on the technical configuration such as PV module and array, inverter configuration, and also the climatic conditions. Therefore, a real operation dataset of DR is necessary to PV engineer in order to estimate energy performance and the LCOE for a particular system. This article presents the annual DR for a group of PV systems in Bangkok, Thailand which share the same monocrystalline silicon (Mono-Si) solar cell and inverter brand, over a four-year period. Instead of using simple linear regression, we apply the linear mixed effects method to estimate the DR value, which is suitable to formula a time-series data. The annual DR was found about 2.7% per year, with the 95% confidence interval from 0.7% to 4.6% per year. Hence, the operation lifetime of PV system until it reaches 80% of their initial energy conversion performance is about 7 years, with the 95% confidence interval from 4 years to 28 years. The resulting DR is informative and useful for further study on PV system performance and cost of investment in tropical region. Furthermore, we are the first group in Thailand to estimate the DR of PV station at system scale based on the mixed effects method. Finally, our study has enriched the knowledge about the operation of Mono-Si PV station in real operation condition.",

For efficient utilization of inherently intermittent renewable energy sources, safe and cost-effective energy storage systems are required. A zinc-air flow battery integrated with a zinc electrolyzer shows great promise as an electricity storage system due to its high specific energy density at low cost. A mathematical model of the system was developed. The model was implemented in MATLAB and validated against experimental results. The validation of the model was verified by the agreement between the simulation and experimental polarization characteristic. The behavior and performance of the system were then examined as a function of different operating parameters: the flow rate of the electrolyte, the initial concentration of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the initial concentration of zincate ion. These parameters significantly affected the performance of the system. The influence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the performance of the system was investigated and discussed as it significantly affected the coulombic efficiencies of both the zinc-air flow battery and the zinc electrolyzer. Optimal KOH concentration was found to be about 6-7 M. Whilst increased KOH concentration enhanced the discharge energy of the battery, it also increased HER of both the battery and the electrolyzer. However, higher initial concentration of zincate ion reduced HER and improved the coulombic efficiency of the system. Besides, a higher flow rate of electrolyte enhanced the performance of the system especially at a high charge/discharge current by maintaining the concentration of active species in the cell. Nevertheless, the battery suffered from a higher rate of HER at a high flow rate. It was noted that the model-based analysis provided better insight into the behavioral characteristics of the system leading to an improved design and operation of the integrated system of zinc-air flow battery with the zinc electrolyzer.",

Heavy oil production depends on reservoir characteristics like permeability, reservoir pressure as well as oil viscosity. The difficulty to produce this oil is its high viscosity. The practical technology to produce this heavy oil is to use steam as steam-flooding method to reduce oil viscosity. However, the huge energy consumption in steam-flooding operation can impact the operating cost as well as a project life. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to measure the viscosity and correlate the results with temperature and to simulate the oil production by using STARS, a CMG program. Moreover, the effects of parameters like well distance, injection rate and permeability on the oil production are also investigated. The simulation results show that oil viscosity and permeability play significant roles in heavy oil production. Also, the higher oil recovery can be obtained by increasing the steam injection rate and shorten the well spacing. These conditions can be applied to use in the real field for heavy oil production. The major benefit of this practice is to reduce the steam consumption and fuel costs and increase more oil production thus extending the economic project life.",

Until now, aqueous-based ZIBs have been the focus of attention. However, the issues regarding hydrogen evolution, and zinc electrode passivation as well as dendrite formation limit their practical application. In this work, a biocompatible, stable and low-cost choline chloride/ urea (ChCl/urea) deep eutectic solvent is reported as an alternative electrolyte for rechargeable ZIBs based on delta-type manganese oxide (\u03b4-MnO2) intercalation electrode. The behavior of the zinc electrode on stripping and deposition in ChCl/urea electrolyte was examined. Besides, the charge storage and charge-transfer characteristics of the battery was studied. The results showed that there was no sign of dendrite formation on the zinc electrode during long-term cycling. Consequently, the fabricated battery exhibited good electrochemical performance with the maximum specific capacity of 170 mAh/g and good cyclability. In addition, the system showed reversible plating/stripping of zinc (Zn) without dendrite formation and no passivation layer on the zinc electrode.

The effects of anionic surfactant types and their concentrations on the gelation mechanism and time of SF were systematically investigated. We found that SDS and STS that have long alkyl chain lengths and high negative charges could accelerate the gelation of SF to occur within 14\u201342 min in a concentration-dependent manner. SOS that has a short alkyl chain length and low negative charge slowly induced SF to gel at around 113\u2013144 h. The mechanisms of SF gelation induced by these three anionic surfactants were supposed to be combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, as well as the self-transition of beta sheets. The SF + STS hydrogels were further employed to encapsulate curcumin for the controlled release application. The SF + 0.09% wt.

Most of these studies have concentrated on using prediction accuracy as a performance metric. Some of them have also performed trading simulations to evaluate financial performance. However, financial performance was not improved significantly because the loss function used in the training process focused primarily on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new framework to train a deep neural network for stock market prediction. A new loss function was developed by adding a risk-reward function, which is derived by the trading simulation results. A new scoring metric called Sharpe-F1 score, which is a combination of Sharpe ratio and F1 score is used for model selection. We employ the best prediction model from our previous work, which consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) architectures and takes event embedding vectors, historical prices and a set of technical indicators as inputs. The robustness of our framework is evaluated on two datasets by varying the key parameters used in the proposed framework. The results show that financial performance can be improved by adding a risk-reward function into the loss function used in the training process.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDecreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by converting to higher-valued product has become of interest. Hydrogen (H2) is an important feedstock required in thermochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals such as methanol. The cost and availability of H2 affect the cost of CO2 conversion. This study is focused on the process simulation of H2 production from ethanol feedstock. Steam reforming of ethanol is compared with dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 with valued products including ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde. Form this study, steam reforming of ethanol presents the lowest cost of H2 production at 1.58 USD/kg H2 while dehydrogenation of ethanol presents the cost at 3.24 and 1.97 USD/kg H2, respectively. Although presenting the lowest cost, steam reforming of ethanol provides a net positive CO2 emission in the overall CO2 conversion to methanol process. In contrast, ethanol dehydrogenation to H2 and byproducts, ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde, promotes a net negative CO2 emission of \u2212819.20 kg/ton methanol and \u22125.42 kg/ton methanol, respectively.

Landfill approach is generally decided for handling most of municipal solid waste, resulting the impacts of environment especially land occupation and global warming. As commercial building plays an importance role not only for economic value but also for environmental aspects, a supermarket located in community mall was selected as a case study towards sustainable cities. This study was aimed to investigate the current MSW management system of supermarket in order to quantify its environmental performance and to propose suitable options for improving municipal solid waste management. The findings revealed that at the business-Asusual, 397 tCO2e was emitted annually from landfilling waste of a supermarket in Thailand. However, if waste management has improved by recycling plus bio-gasification approach, not only 374 tCO2e/year will not be emitted from landfilling, but 243 tCO2e/year also be reduced due to the activities in relevant to recycling and bio-gasification process. Moreover, applying such approach provides benefit in economic term about 18,321 USD a year.

        "Title": "Improvement of Relative Permeability and Wetting Condition of Sandstone by Low Salinity Waterflooding",
        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Waterflooding is generally performed to maintain reservoir pressure and as a consequence, production period is extended. However, conventional waterflooding may be not suitable for every reservoir. Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSW) which is recently the most mentioned technique is therefore, considered. Although clear explanation of oil recovery mechanism is not available, it is believed that the key mechanism is Multi-component Ion Exchange (MIE). This study aims to assess improvement of relative permeability and wetting condition of sandstone formation from oilfield in Thailand, through the MIE mechanism. The study is divided into two major parts. The first part is laboratory study including core and fluid preparations, imbibition test, coreflooding test and ion-exchange detection. After laboratory data including fluid production rate and pressure difference versus time are obtained, core simulation using reservoir simulation program called STAR\u00ae commercialized by Computer Modelling Group (CMG) is performed to study the change of wetting condition through the shifting of relative permeability. Obtaining results would help verifying suitability of the implementation of this technique in oilfield. Results from imbibition test showed that LSW yields higher oil recovery factor compared to formation water. Diluted formation water at 5,000 ppm which is approximately one-third of formation water, is the best water formulation, yielding the fastest rate of imbibition in this study. From ion-exchange detection test, results showed the variation of divalent ion concentrations compared to injected water and moreover, presence of calcium and magnesium ions in oil phase supports the occurrence of MIE during the displacement mechanism. The theoretical model matching with physical data using reservoir simulation program indicates that LSW slightly affects the original wetting condition. Water wetness is lessened as can be observed from the increment of relative permeability to water at the end point saturation. Moreover, LSW reduces residual oil saturation and at the same time, increases relative permeability to oil. From the detection of MIE together with the observation of wetting condition through core simulation, it can be concluded that LSW is a promising technique for oilfield in Thailand. As produced water must be reinjected back into reservoir based on zero discharge regulation of Thai government, this low-cost technique of diluting water salinity prior to reinjection would fulfil the requirement of government and at the same time helps increasing oil recovery of the total field.",

In this paper, advertisement text datasets from Facebook were labelled as the stages of AISAS model and learned to be classified by machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, like many other real-world data, our dataset had imbalanced class distribution. The classifier algorithms tend to predict mostly the majority class.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019, KSME & Springer.The single-, double- or multiple-cell entrapment efficacy is crucial in various aspects of biological studies. In this study, both computational and experimental approaches were conducted to explore the effect of the cell and microwell sizes on the ability of cell-trapping in a triangular microwell. From computational studies, it was found that the interaction between a spanwise vortex on the upper part and counter-rotating streamwise vortices at the leading edge helped to form a pair of secondary streamwise vortices deeper inside the microwell. The strength and size of these secondary streamwise vortices, which depended on the size of the microwell, played an important role in the arrangement of entrapped cells. The experimental results, with both microbeads and white blood cells (WBCs), were in good agreement with the simulated ones, and suggested that the ratio between the cell and microwell sizes was an important factor in the efficacy of single-, double- and multiple-cell cell-trapping. Entrapment of canine WBCs (size distribution between 7\u201315 \u00b5m) attained a highest single-cell trapping efficiency of 20.4 % in the array of 40-\u00b5m triangular microwells of 30 \u00b5m depth at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/h, but this was reduced to 16.5 and 10.6 % in the 60- and 80-\u00b5m microwells, respectively, under the same conditions.",

Using only responsive conventional power plants is difficult to manage this problem. Thus, the battery energy storage that has quick response receives high interest, recently. This paper proposes a methodology to determine an appropriate size of battery as a backup system in generation system.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Modified airlift reactor (MALR) was developed for improving the oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) by installing the slanted baffles in the riser compartment. MALR can enhance KLa value up to 97% compared to a regular reactor. However, insufficient analysis of the hydrodynamics and other oxygen transfer parameters of this new reactor has been performed to date. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse local gas-liquid dynamics and evaluate the oxygen transfer performance in MALR compared to regular reactors using clean water as a liquid phase. Air bubble distribution was employed in terms of bubble diameter, rising velocity, and interfacial area. Slanted baffles maintained the bubble size between 3.88 and 4.63 mm for the studied superficial gas velocity (Ug), which is smaller than that in airlift reactor (ALR) by approximately 0.2 mm. Bubble rising velocity (UB) is relatively increased with Ug, regardless of reactor classes. New reactor could extend the bubble residence in the water by lengthening the bubble stream path of the slanted baffles leading to decrease UB values about 39% and 52% compared to bubble column reactor (BCR) and ALR, respectively. These performances consequently resulted in an interfacial area almost two times higher than in regular reactors. Oxygen transfer improved in MALR with an extra amount of oxygen transfer efficiency of 1.57% and 0.63% over BCR and ALR, respectively. This resulted in the highest aeration efficiency (AE) compared to other examined reactors, following a trendline expression of AE 0.046 Ug-0.6. Insertion of slanted baffles produced 5% and 12.8% more dead zone volume than ALR and BCR, respectively. In conclusion, MALR can significantly enhance oxygen transfer performance due to the ability to maintain bubble size and extend the gas-liquid transfer period.",

Since the equipment in substation hardly fails to operate, the information about failure is not yet systematically recorded.

In particular, the Weibull distribution model is used to estimate reliability function of equipment. A maintenance planning may lead to different final condition of effective age of equipment. We propose the optimal maintenance planning in conjunction with the specified final condition of equipment and compare the LCC and reliability.

Wood residue and CaO are used as a biomass feedstock and a CO2 sorbent, respectively. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using ASPEN Plus. The effect of change in major parameters, i.e., gasifying temperature, carbonation temperature and CaO/C ratio, on the product gas composition is investigated. The H2 concentration of the product gas leaving the gasifier is found to increase as the gasifying temperature increases and reaches its maximum value when the gasifying temperature is higher than 700 \u00b0C. For the integrated process, the H2 concentration significantly decreases as the carbonation temperature increases to higher than 500 \u00b0C. Moreover, the result indicates that the CaO/C ratio should be maintained at a value higher than 3.17 to ensure that the generated CO2 is completely captured. The energetic and exergetic performances, as well as the environmental impact of the integrated process at various amounts of recycled CO2, are also investigated. The energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency based on H2 production increase as the CO2/C ratio increases, whereas the CO2 emission shows the opposite trend.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Nearly 35% of passenger vehicle accident deaths are from rollover crashes. In vehicle stability control system, the active rollover prevention is presented to prevent rollovers. An imminent rollover should be detected immediately through accurate and reliable detection for active vehicle rollover prevention. A traditional rollover index is able to detect un-tripped rollovers. However, it fails to detect tripped rollovers from external inputs such as tripping by the force of a vehicle striking a curb or a road bump. Thus, a new neural network algorithm to detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers is needed so any estimation algorithms to determine unknown parameters will no longer be used. The neural network algorithm uses multi-variables from available sensors on the vehicle to calculate and categorize the rollover warning into 3 levels: 'Safe', 'Low Risk', and 'High Risk'. Moreover, the algorithm can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollover by testing with a 1/5th scaled vehicle. In order to show dynamic similarity between the 1/5th scale vehicle and a full-sized vehicle, the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem is used. From experiment results, it is clear that the neural network algorithm can be used to accurately enable the rollover warning for the tripped and un-tripped rollover.",

We employ an approach of robust H2 hierarchical decentralized control. This approach utilizes a linear quadratic performance criterion which composes of local and global terms. Local term represents local control action of agents whereas the global term deals with cooperation among agents. We formulate design of the local and global feedback control laws as optimization over linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, the LMI formulation can incorporate a specified constraint on disturbance attenuation.

BC pellicle was immersed in a diluted NR latex (NRL) suspension in the presence of ethanol aqueous solution. Effects of NRL concentrations (0.5%-10% dry rubber content, DRC) and immersion temperatures (30-70 \u00b0C) on the film characteristics were studied. It was revealed that the combination of nanocellulose fibrous networks and NR polymer provided a synergistic effect on the mechanical properties of NR-BC films. In comparison with BC films, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the NR-BC films were considerably improved ~4-fold. The NR-BC films also exhibited improved water resistance over that of BC films and possessed a high resistance to non-polar solvents such as toluene. NR-BC films were biodegradable and could be degraded completely within 5-6 weeks in soil.",

This study presents a synergistic catalytic system using the combination of Br\u00f8nsted hydrothermal carbon-based acid (HTCG-SO 3 H) and Lewis acid catalysts for one-pot conversion of cellulose to levulinic acid (LA). Chromium chloride (CrCl 3 ), among a number of other Lewis acidic metal chlorides, was found to give the highest LA yields, and was therefore used in combination with the HTCG-SO 3 H, for cellulose conversion to LA. With the appropriate amount of HTCG-SO 3 H, the formation of side products could be reduced, resulting in improved selectivity of LA. Compared with that obtained by CrCl 3 alone, at 5 wt % HTCG-SO 3 H, 0.015 M CrCl 3 , 200 \u00b0C and 5 min reaction time, the LA yield was considerably enhanced from 30 wt % to 40 wt %.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Authors.The production of volatile fatty acid (VFA)-rich leachate as feedstock for methane production is an essential and rate-limiting step in two-stage grass biogasification. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of leachate dilution, inoculum, recirculation, and buffering agent addition on the acidification of Napier grass in anaerobic leach bed reactors (AnLBRs). Four AnLBRs with 14.17 L effective volume were operated at ambient temperature for 28 days in each experiment. The results clearly demonstrate the significance of the control parameters, particularly leachate dilution and inoculum, in the regulation of grass solubilization. Different dilutions of leachate produced different grass degradation rates. These different dilutions generated 95.62-112.63 g of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) or 0.52-0.62 g SCOD/g VSadded for those diluted at 1.0-7.0-day intervals compared to 51.50 g SCOD or 0.28 g SCOD/g VSadded for those without dilution. Adding inoculums of 10-30% increased the SCOD to 67.01-115.65 g SCOD or 0.40-0.59 g SCOD/g VSadded. While leachate recirculation and the addition of a buffering agent had less influence on solubilization, which increased by only 6.80-16.41% of SCOD produced. These produced leachates contained orderly acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The proposed conditions (20% of added inoculum and leachate dilution at a 3.0-day interval), yielded practical degrees of solubilization and acidification of 46.61% and 62.21%, respectively, or 0.56 g SCOD/g VSadded and 0.26 g VFA/g VSadded. These results demonstrate that beneficial control conditions can promote the rapid and practical production of VFAs from grass biomass via an AnLBR.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019A general approach to managing municipal solid waste is by incineration. Unfortunately, large amounts of municipal-solid-waste-incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) is produced in the process, with their heavy metals content posing further problems to the environment. One fundamental treatment of MSWI FA heavy metals is called solidification-stabilization, where MSWI FA is solidified in cement-based materials to cap hazardous elements from being released into the environment. Mortar formed from this cement mixed with MSWI FA suffer from decreased compressive strength due to their chloride and sulfate contents. Thus, pre-treatment of MSWI FA to remove these salts before producing mortar is desirable. This study investigated treating MSWI FA with deionized water, 0.01 M and 0.1 M nitric acid, and 0.1 M and 0.25 M sodium carbonate to remove chloride and sulfate. Physical and chemical structures of treated and untreated MSWI FA was studied to understand the chloride and sulfate removal mechanisms. Treated MSWI FA was used as cement replacement in mortar, and the compressive strength was tested. Results suggest that all of the treatment solutions tested in this study can equally remove chloride (around 250,000 mg/kg), but sodium carbonate can remove sulfate at the highest extent (15,821 mg/kg). In addition, mortar with deionized-water-treated MSWI FA gave the highest compressive strength. Heavy metals leaching was tested by the Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure (TCLP) method, with results passing the standard.",

Based on the concept of wireless mesh network, the NerveNet is a disaster-resilient mesh-topology network which is strong against failures in disaster. Moreover, vehicles are considered as a key component in which MDRU can be deployed.

We also show our implementation of the network switching algorithm for selecting either NerveNet or LTE for the HetVNet. The real experiments were conducted using the campus shuttle buses in Chulalongkorn University. The results show that the proposed framework can operate well in normal scenario, HetVNet scenario, and disaster scenario. Specifically, in the disaster situation where LTE network is not available, all of the data traffic is transferred via NerveNet. In the normal situation where NerveNet and LTE networks are available, the data traffic can be transferred over both of them.",

The beam element is modeled as a composite consisting of the bulk material and the surface material layer. Both Eringen nonlocal elasticity theory and Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory are adopted to formulate the moment-curvature relationship of the beam. In the formulation, the pre-existing residual stress within the bulk material, induced by the residual surface tension in the material layer, is also taken into account. The resulting moment-curvature relationship is then utilized together with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the elliptic integral technique to establish a set of exact algebraic equations governing the displacements and rotations at the ends of the beam. The linearized version of those equations is also established and used in the derivation of a closed-form solution of the buckling load of nano-beams under various end conditions. A discretization-free solution procedure based mainly upon Newton iterative scheme and a selected numerical quadrature is developed to solve a system of fully coupled nonlinear equations. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique yields highly accurate results comparable to the benchmark analytical solutions. In addition, the nonlocal and surface energy effects play a significant role on the predicted buckling load, post-buckling and bending responses of the nano-beam. In particular, the presence of those effects remarkably alters the overall stiffness of the beam and predicted solutions exhibit strong size-dependence when the characteristic length of the beam is comparable to the intrinsic length scale of the material surface.",

Rice straw contains high potassium and other components which may lower ash melting point causing bed agglomeration. This study focused on the effect of alumina and silica ratio of bed materials in fluidized bed gasifier. The ratio of alumina bed was 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0. The experiments were performed at 700, 800 and 900\u00b0C with equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.2. Rice straw size 425-850 \u03bcm was used as raw materials. The result showed that the high ratio of alumina deceased bed agglomeration at 700\u00b0C. However, similar alumina ratio increased bed agglomeration at 800 and 900\u00b0C. In addition, the effect of temperature on defluidization time was significant. As the operating temperature increased, the defluidization time decreased. Although the ratio of the bed material was different but the result of defluidization time show a similar trend. As a result, high operating temperature may not suitable for fluidized bed gasification with this particular biomass. The SEM/EDS analyzed showed that potassium, calcium and silicate are major element in a linkage between bed particles. As a result, 75% of alumina bed ratio at 700\u00b0C was sufficient to avoid bed agglomeration during fluidized bed gasification of rice straw. In conclusion, specific ratio of alumina and silica can prevent agglomeration in fluidized bed gasification of rice straw when operating temperature lower than apparent eutectic melting point of involved alkalis from rice straw. The result from this investigation may lead to options on mitigating the problem of bed agglomeration in fluidized bed gasifier of rice straw.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.An electrochemical biosensor comprising copper, nano-diamond (ND) and carbon nanotube (CNT) has been fabricated to detect the amino acids of Parkia speciosa (PS) seeds. Parkia speciosa (stink bean), a Southeast Asian legume, is composed of medicinal chemicals which exhibit biological activities. The electro-catalytic activity of three electrodes Cu/CNT/ND, Zn/CNT/ND and NiO/CNT/ND was studied using 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 MKCl. The Zn/CNT/ND electrode exhibited irreversible reaction free oxidation with reduction peaks at -1 V, whereas, a pair redox peaks was observed for Cu/CNT/ND electrode. The immobilization of l-amino acid oxidase on the Cu/CNT/ND electrode was carried out to catalyze the amino acids detection. It was observed that the anodic and cathodic peak currents increased linearly with both the square root of the scan rate (\u03bd1/2) and scan rate (\u03bd) over the studied scan range of 0.01-0.1 V/s with high correlation coefficients and following both the adsorption and the diffusion-controlled mechanisms. The developed biosensor displayed a very good electro-catalytic activity toward the oxidation of the amino acid to release H2O2 and NH3 as a result of the reaction between the active sites and the Parkia speciosa component. This was also confirmed by a drop in the pH value from 6.8 to 6.5 and a change in the color of the solution from green to yellow (releasing H2S). The impedance results indicated an inductance behavior due to the co-formation of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the water via the adsorption on the electrode surface.",

This experiment is using low-carbon steel sheet that were cold rolled at the same reduction ratio. Then annealed applying by different annealing temperature and soaking time in laboratory furnace. The mechanical properties which were examined. Yield strength, Tensile strength, %Elongation and Hardness. The result showed that (1) Increasing the annealing temperature could remarkably decrease the yield strength, tensile strength and hardness, whereas the %Elongation could be increased. (2) Increasing the soaking time could slightly effect on mechanical properties. (3) The annealing temperature of 650\u00b0C with soaking time of 2 hr should be applied to provide the mechanical properties close to target value (4) Grain size of the workpieces trended to be grown from the annealing temperature of 610\u00b0C.The experiment it can be concluded that annealing temperature and soaking time have significant effect on the mechanical properties variation in batch annealing.",

All rights reserved.In this present study, characteristics and catalytic properties of different VOx/SBA-15 catalysts for oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde were determined and well related. First, the SBA-15 supports were synthesized using the sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods with Zr and La modification. Then, VOx species (2 wt% of V) were deposited on different SBA-15 supports. Among all catalysts, the V-Zr-La/SBA-15-HT showed the highest catalytic activity having 80% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 38% at 400 \u00b0C in non-oxidative dehydrogenation, while 98% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40% were obtained for this catalyst at lower temperature (300 \u00b0C) in oxidative dehydrogenation. In fact, two of the most powerful techniques used to elucidate the nature of VOx species dispersed on Zr-La/SBA -15 supports were X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption. It is worth noting that isolated monomeric VOx species, particularly the V4+ species, as well as the amounts of weak basic sites essentially played important role in non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde.",

After the performance test, we find that our model could yield the higher F1 than traditional text classification techniques including Naive Bayes and SVM. In addition, we innovate the open dataset called 'Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC)' that was compiled from many decades of Thai Supreme Court criminal judgements.

From soil moisture field monitored at four depths, Hydrus-1D was applied to simulate water movement with soil hydraulic parameter estimates using field data for calibration. To understand deep percolation characteristics, rainfall, irrigation water and evaporation (called effective infiltration) inputs were monitored and used to simulate the effect of the pronounced climatic gradient (precipitation) and soil depths variability on percolation fluxes and applied the calibrated model. The effective infiltration and percolation at 2m depth is applied to detect the deep percolation changes and are described in the wetting and drying stages of soil. The study found that the effect of evaporation makes different percolation characteristics at shallower (1 m) and deeper (2 m) of soil layers. The daily maximum deep percolation (at 2 m) is 4.43 cm/ day when the soil moisture is saturated at 39%. The average rate of percolation (at 2 m) in the study period is 0.52 cm/day from the total input of effective infiltration. The percolation rate increased in soil with higher effective infiltration rate, deeper water table, soil moisture value in the subsoil (between saturation and field capacity). The ratio of total deep percolation and effective infiltration is 0.19 and the total deep percolation is 0.42 of rainfall plus irrigation in the rainy season. This study provided the understandings of deep percolation characteristics, its percolation rate and overall water balance of deep percolation system by using Hydrus-1D model with calibrated data from soil moisture sensors in the field.",

All rights reserved.Irrigation has contributed significantly to poverty alleviation, food security, and improving the quality of life for rural populations. However, infiltration of irrigation water in excess of available root zone storage from agricultural lands with poorer water quality may carry both agricultural chemicals and naturally recharge to groundwater, rivers, and lakes. In recent years water security concerns have centered on groundwater depletion by withdrawals for irrigated agriculture and groundwater quality degradation both from natural and anthropogenic origin, and only limited attention has been paid to the more insidious (and more chronic) problems of progressive aquifer contamination of groundwater recharge by irrigation return flows, which is occurring in major intensive agricultural practices. Environmental vulnerability and risk assessment is a step towards identification, analysis, and classification of vulnerable and risk factors as well as its long-term implications, and thus reduction of the possibility of adverse consequences from irrigation, are the primary objective of this present study. A novel approach for environmental impact of irrigation to groundwater contamination and aquifer vulnerability assessment is initiated and applied by combining a novel aquifer vulnerability DRASTIC map with pollution severity and prioritization based in probability of occurrence of pollution using TOPSIS ranking method. 9% of the total study area is categorized as high risk level which needs intensive groundwater samples from domestic and monitoring wells at various depths (100 samples from <30 m deep, and 60 samples from >60 m deep) are collected and analyzed for nitrate (as NO3-), K. sulphate (as SO42-) and other water quality parameters. NO3- level in groundwater ranged from 0.18 to 151 mg/L. Consistent K and NO3- trends from municipal wells in the study area indicate that nitrate source is likely agricultural origin. Detection of high nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater suggests the direct association of major nitrate concentration in groundwater aquifer with potential surficial source on the ground.",

We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the surface density of star formation in z \u223c 2 galaxies and study the different physical properties between galaxies within and above the star-formation main sequence of galaxies. Methods. We use ALMA images at 870 \u00b5m with 0.2 arcsec resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field. This sample is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. Results. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of \u223c150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these \u201cstarbursts hidden in the main sequence\u201d also exist below 1011 M. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.",

A simulation of random locations was initially performed to define the studied locations.

Non-linear one-dimensional site response analysis was performed to investigate the surface ground motion, amplification factor, and spectral acceleration during short (0.2 s) and long (1 s) time periods. In general, it is important to consider the ground spatial variation in any seismic ground response analysis. The results show that Bangkok subsoils could magnify the seismic wave during an earthquake. For example, in the 2011 Tarlay earthquake, the magnification varied from two- to four-fold.

It has been applied in many applications such as landfill, cement industry or raw feed for clinker, concrete, etc. Furthermore, it can be used in agriculture to improve soil quality. However, the utilization rate of bottom ash in agriculture is still very low only 0.1% of bottom ash. The properties of bottom ash can adjust the pH in soil and provide some nutrients to improve soil quality. Moreover, the soil degradation is a major problem in agricultural countries. The soil degradation is the decline in soil quality due to the improper land use, agriculture with misuse or excess use of fertilizers and so on. In Thailand, the soil degradation is a serious problem in agriculture in the northern mountainous areas. The mainly causes of soil degradation are from human activities such as overuse of pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer, deforestation, expansion of cultivated areas. Therefore, the objective of this research is to apply the bottom ash from Mae-Moh power plant to improve soil quality of degraded soil in Nan province, Thailand and to investigate the effects of amount of bottom ash from 0-30% by weight on some parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density and soil texture. From the result, it is clear that with higher amount of bottom ash, the quality of degraded soil has been improved especially pH and soil texture. The pH can increase from 5.664 up to 7.408. Soil texture can change from clay to loam or sandy loam. The bulk density of soil decreases at all rates of bottom ash which is favorable for plant growth. This research can be applied for soil amendment and is expected to improve the yield for plant growing. Furthermore, the practical combinations of 10% and 20% of bottom ash are considered to apply in the real field to evaluate the improvement on soil properties in the future.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.A single-column reactive distillation is employed to convert waste cooking oil to biodiesel via simultaneous esterification and transesterification reactions. The waste cooking oil contained 10 wt% of free fatty acid (FFA) and the contaminated water (2-8 wt%) was used as feedstocks for biodiesel production. Esterification was occurred in the upper of column to reduce FFA content to less than 1 wt% and to prevent the simultaneous saponification by base catalyst. Moreover, the contaminated water and by-product water (from esterification) together was removed in-situ as the distillate product. The reactive distillation has been optimally designed to have 16 stages consisting of 5 esterification, 9 transesterification stages and each stage for reboiler and condenser. The feed locations of oil and methanol were at the top of the column and at stage 6, respectively. The optimum methanol to oil ratio was 6:1 with reflux ratio 0.1 while the reboiler duty was in the range of 100-150 kW depended on the water content. This condition successfully converts 97 wt% of waste cooking oil to biodiesel with 96.5% purity.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 SPIE.A numerical modelling to theoretically investigate and analyse the characteristic of the surface functionalised optical fibre based sensor to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) biomarker is introduced in this paper. A 125-micron diameter of coreless silica fibre (CSF) connected to single-mode fibre (SMF) at both ends to achieve a structure of SMF-CSF-SMG is proposed to detect VOCs biomarkers for diabetes such as acetone and isopropanol. The coreless fibre region is considered to be a sensing region where the multimode interference (MMI) occurs having a higher light interaction at the interface between the fibre and sensing medium which leads to the enhancement of sensitivity. The sensing region undergoes surface functionalisation with Au-silane for the sensor to be selectively detect VOCs biomarker with electrostatic absorption. The length of the sensing region is numerically optimised to achieve a reimaging distance where the highest possible of coupling efficiency occurs and the maximum output signal can be obtained. Coupling efficiency spectra at different volume fractions of gold nanoparticles with various acetone and isopropanol concentrations are also presented. A sensitivity of the Au-silane functionalised optical fibre sensor is achieved by using the analysis of wavelength shift interrogation. The results show the spectra undergoes red-shift phenomenon in the near-infrared region (NIR) when concentrations of acetone and isopropanol are increased. The functionalisation of Au-silane on the optical fibre sensor provides a higher sensitivity compared to the unfunctionalised sensor as it shows more dramatic shifts of absorption spectra when there is a change in VOCs biomarker concentration.",

Among others, emotional state is one of the conditions that could be of interest to doctors or caregivers. This paper discusses a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that is a low cost, single channel, dry contact, in-ear EEG suitable for non-intrusive monitoring. All aspects of the designs, engineering, and experimenting by applying machine learning for emotion classification, are covered. Based on the valence and arousal emotion model, the device is able to classify basic emotion with 71.07% accuracy (valence), 72.89% accuracy (arousal), and 53.72% (all four emotions). The results are comparable to those measured from the more conventional EEG headsets at T7 and T8 scalp positions. These results, together with its earphone-like wearability, suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare applications, such as home-based or tele-monitoring systems as intended.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.A drift-flux correlation has been often used to predict void fraction of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal channel due to its simplicity and practicality. The drift-flux correlation includes two important drift-flux parameters, namely, the distribution parameter and void-fraction-weighted-mean drift velocity. In this study, an extensive literature survey for horizontal two-phase flow is conducted to establish void fraction database and to acquire existing drift-flux correlations. A total of 566 data is collected from 12 data sources and 4 flow-regime-dependent and 1 flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlations are identified. The predictive capability of the existing drift-flux correlations is assessed using the collected data. It is pointed out that the drift velocity determined by a regression analysis may include a significant error due to a compensation error between distribution parameter and drift velocity. In this study, a simple flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlation is developed. In the modeling approach, the void-fraction-weighted mean drift velocity is approximated to be 0 m/s, whereas the distribution parameter is given as a simple function of the ratio of non-dimensional superficial gas velocity to non-dimensional mixture volumetric flux. The newly developed correlation shows an excellent predictive capability of void fraction for horizontal two-phase flow. Mean absolute error (or bias), standard deviation (random error), mean relative deviation and mean absolute relative deviation of the correlation are 0.0487, 0.0985, 0.0758 and 0.206, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the correlation is similar to the correlation of Chexal et al. (1991), which was formulated based on the drift-flux parameters by means of many cascading constitutive relationships with numerous empirical parameters.",

Complex machine learning algorithms such as deep learning methods can analyze and detect complex data patterns. The recent prediction models use two types of inputs as (i) numerical information such as historical prices and technical indicators, and (ii) textual information including news contents or headlines. However, the use of textual data involves text representation construction. Traditional methods like word embedding may not be suitable for representing the semantics of financial news due to problems of word sparsity in datasets. In this paper, we aim to improve stock market predictions using a deep learning approach with event embedding vectors extracted from news headlines, historical price data, and a set of technical indicators as input. Our prediction model consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architectures. We use accuracy and annualized return based on trading simulation as performance metrics, and then perform experiments on three datasets obtained from different news sources namely Reuters, Reddit, and Intrinio. Results show that enhancing text representation vectors and considering both numerical and textual information as input to a deep neural network can improve prediction performance.",

The purity of bottom layer products of continuous jig was lower than those of batch jig because of light particle entrainment induced by the screw-type extractor. To minimize entrainment, a new discharge system consisting of a vertical restraining wall and a screw-type extractor was developed. The restraining wall was installed close to the \u201cproduct-end\u201d to separate the jig chamber into two and allow particles to transfer from one part to the other via the gap under the wall. The experimental results showed that this proposed discharge system could improve the purity of heavy particles in bottom layer products because of two reasons: (1) higher material mass ratio of heavy plastic close to product-end, and (2) changes in the flow of water and particles. Moreover, the purity of bottom layer products during continuous jig separation was influenced by the difference of material mass ratio in feed; that is, purity was higher when the ratio of heavy plastic was high. In addition, an estimation procedure based on multi-step treatment using separation curves is proposed to achieve the target purity of bottom layer products.",

Administrations of cancer-specific neoepitopes in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have been proven effective in both mouse models and human patients. Because only a tiny fraction of cancer-specific neoepitopes actually elicits immune response, selection of potent, immunogenic neoepitopes remains a challenging step in cancer vaccine development. A basic approach for immunogenicity prediction is based on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with high affinity. Results: In this study, we developed MHCSeqNet, an open-source deep learning model, which not only outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on both MHC binding affinity and MHC ligand peptidome datasets but also exhibits promising generalization to unseen MHC class I alleles. MHCSeqNet employed neural network architectures developed for natural language processing to model amino acid sequence representations of MHC allele and epitope peptide as sentences with amino acids as individual words. This consideration allows MHCSeqNet to accept new MHC alleles as well as peptides of any length. Conclusions: The improved performance and the flexibility offered by MHCSeqNet should make it a valuable tool for screening effective neoepitopes in cancer vaccine development.",

        "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The present research focuses on elucidating of the impact of Lewis acids including AlCl3 and FeCl2 addition on catalytic behaviors during ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization over the TiCl4/MgCl2/THF catalyst (Cat. A). In this study, the Cat. A with the absence and presence of Lewis acids was synthesized via the chemical route. Then, all catalyst samples were characterized and tested in the slurry polymerization. For ethylene polymerization, using the Cat. A with the presence of AlCl3 apparently gave the highest activity among other catalysts. In addition, the activity of catalysts tended to increase with the presence of the Lewis acids. This can be attributed to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of Lewis acids leading to larger amounts of the isolated Ti species. Moreover, with the presence of Lewis acids, the effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity was also less pronounced. Considering ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the catalyst with the presence of mixed Lewis acids (AlCl3 + FeCl2) exhibited the highest activity. It is suggested that the presence of mixed Lewis acids possibly caused a change in acidity of active sites, which is suitable for copolymerization. However, activities of all catalysts in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization were lower than those in ethylene polymerization. The effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system was found to be similar with the presence of Lewis acids. Based on this study, it is quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper Lewis acids, especially when the pressure of hydrogen increases. The characteristics of polymers obtained upon the presence of Lewis acids will be discussed further in more detail.",

In this paper we propose a systematic approach that transforms primitive-level designs (firm-cores) to vendor independent designs (soft-cores), while modularising them during the process. This makes modification and implementation of designs on any FPGA devices possible. To demonstrate the idea, our soft-core version of PicoBlaze is implemented on a Lattice iCE40LP1k FPGA device and is shown to be fully compatible with the original PicoBlaze macro. Rigorous verification mechanisms have been employed to ensure the validity of the porting process; therefore, the quality of transformation matches the industry expectation.",

In the SECLR-WS process, the biogas feed is partially oxidized using iron oxide and CO2 is captured by CaO in the fuel reactor (FR) to produce H2-rich syngas. The iron oxide is re-oxidized in the steam reactor (SR) to generate a high-purity H2 stream and CaO is regenerated in the calcinator. The simulation of the SECLR-WS process was based on a thermodynamic approach and was performed using an Aspen Plus simulator. The effects of key parameters such as the steam feed to the FR to methane (SFR/CH4) and iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) to CH4 (Fe3O4/CH4) molar ratios on the process performance in terms of H2 yield and purity, and CH4 conversion were investigated. The results showed that the H2 yield, H2 purity in the FR, and CH4 conversion could be improved by increasing the SFR/CH4 and CaO/CH4 molar ratios. A total H2 yield of 3.8 and a H2 purity in the FR of 97.01 mol% can be obtained at the FR and SR temperatures of 610 and 500 \u00b0C, and SFR/CH4, CaO/CH4, Fe3O4/CH4, and SSR/CH4 molar ratios of 2.2, 1.66, 1, and 2.87, respectively. The molar concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the high-purity H2 stream could be reduced by increasing the pressure in the SR and the amount of CO2 in the biogas feed stream negatively affected the performance of the system.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019Double-link failure models, in which any two links in the network fail in an arbitrary order, are becoming critical in survivable optical network designs. Optical networks that are over-dimensioned and purposely preplanned for full protection against any single-link failure may not survive well in an event of a double-link failure. It is therefore important to understand how much impact a subsequent second link failure may have upon traffic recovery of both failed links. This paper primarily aims to investigate traffic recoverability when a double-link failure occurs. We propose several methods for improving traffic recovery without using additional backup capacities other than the existing backup resources available for single-link failure recovery. In each proposed method, integer linear programming formulation is derived to optimize the backup resource allocation. Numerical results on various network configurations have shed some light on how network operators can choose one of five alternative methods to better handle a double-link failure. From numerical results, Method 1 offers some improvement on the traffic recoverability of the second failed link without disturbing the recovered traffic of the first failed link. Method 2 reveals that the traffic recoverability of the first failed link can be improved if the backup routes of the unrecovered traffic of the first failed link can be reassigned. Method 3 is useful for maximizing the traffic recoverability of the first failed link. Method 4 further increases the recoverability of the second failed link while maintaining the same recoverability of the first failed link as Method 3. Finally, Method 5 accomplishes the maximum overall traffic recoverability.",

The process performances in terms of hydrogen productivity, hydrogen purity, ethanol conversion, CO2 capture ability and thermal efficiency were compared at their maximized net hydrogen. The simulation results showed that the sorption enhanced processes yield better performances than the conventional ESR and CLR because their in situ CO2 sorption increases hydrogen production and provides heat from the sorption reaction.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Carl Hanser Verlag, M\u00fcnchenMetal foam is a high-porosity engineering material which has many outstanding properties such as light weight, high specific strength and stiffness, large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation. The impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces a new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) or co-continuous composites due to the interconnection on a macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This innovative composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results show that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxyresin, results in IPCs stiffer than either of the two individual materials bythemselves. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam.",

Using a notion of augmented clause every symmetric version can be learned. The task of unit propagation is then transformed into a search problem under a permutation group. Our work focuses on a special kind of symmetry called row symmetry. We present the optimization to the search problem under a group containing row symmetry subgroups mainly relies on lexicographic pruning and the fact that some instances can be reduced to minimal assignment problems. We also introduce a construction of subgroups of row symmetry groups to ensure that every sub-task could be performed in polynomial time. Lastly, we discuss the implementation of our technique and some of the technical issue that needed to be address.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)The durability and performance of an air electrode can have a crucial impact on rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). A typical air electrode fabricated using conductive carbon and a polymeric binder suffers rapid degradation during charging, stemming from oxygen bubbles erosion and carbon corrosion. This work presents a durable air electrode having a self-supported sulfur-doped manganese oxides (MnOx-S) electrocatalyst prepared through hydrothermal process followed by ambient temperature sulfurization. Upon sulfurization, MnO2 nanoflakes are transformed into MnOx-S having a heterostructure of Mn3O4, MnO2 and MnSx. MnOx-S provided superior electrochemical properties for both oxygen reduction reaction (Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec) and oxygen evolution reaction (Tafel slope of 80 mV/dec). Self-supported electrodes using MnOx-S and MnO2 electrocatalysts were scrutinized in a bi-electrode rechargeable ZAB having a stagnant electrolyte. In the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode, both significant discharge peak power density (74 mW/cm2 at 135 mA/cm2) as well as low voltage difference between charge and discharge processes (0.75 V) were observed. In addition, for charge-discharge cycling at 20 mA/cm2, the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode achieved stable cycling through 2000 cycles without apparent degradation. The air electrode having the self-supported MnOx-S paves the way for a more durable and higher performance favoring practical application for rechargeable ZABs.",

Its efficient application as filler/additives incorporates the improvement in concomitant properties within materials, e.g., strength, which involves interactions between talc particles and aqueous/nonaqueous matrices. Successful property enhancement imposes ideal mixing and homogenous adhesion within a talc particle, but they are limited by the coexistence of face and edge surfaces of talc, which exhibit different level of hydrophobicity. Here, using atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy, we showed that although hydrophilic talc particles obtained from acid treatment or aminosilanization better adhered with materials representing a matrix, the anisotropic characters of the two surface types persisted. Conversely, the degree of talc's surface anisotropy reduced with the surface hydrophobization by aliphatic methylsilanization, but followed by the decrease in adhesion. With ten-fold difference in Hamaker constants of the probe/talc surface interacting pairs, we showed that the adhesions resulted from van der Waals interactions that suggested the influence of surface polarity. The insight from this work would provide grounds for strategies to modulate talc's adhesion, hydrophobicity and surface uniformity.",

This paper studies the relationship between movie factors and its revenue and build prediction models. Besides analysis on aggregate data, we also divide data into groups using different methods and compare accuracy across these techniques as well as explore whether clustering techniques could help improve accuracy. Specifically, two major steps were employed. Initially, linear regression, polynomial regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied on the entire movie data to predict the movie revenue. Then, clustering techniques, such as by genre, using Expectation Maximization (EM) and using K-means were applied to divide data into groups before regression analyses are executed. To compare accuracy among different techniques, R-square and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used as a performance indicator. Our study shows that generally linear regression without clustering offers the model with the highest R-square, while linear regression with EM clustering yields the lowest RMSE.",

The catalysts were prepared via impregnation of Ag and Li onto TiO2 having different phases [anatase (A), rutile (R) and mixed phases (AR)]. The structure of different AgLi/TiO2 catalysts was confirmed using various techniques including XRD, N2 physisorption, SEM-EDX, ICP, FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD. The results from non-oxidative dehydrogenation indicated that AgLi/TiO2-A catalyst exhibited the highest acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40 % at 300\u00e2\u00b0C, while acetaldehyde yield of ca. 66 % was obtained for AgLi/TiO2-AR catalyst at 300\u00e2\u00b0C in oxidative dehydrogenation. On the basis of experimental results, we conclude that the phases transition of TiO2 strongly affects the physicochemical properties of AgLi/TiO2 catalysts. The influence of catalyst properties such as the strength of basic sites and reduction behaviors have been a positive synergetic effect for enhancing the catalytic performance of both reactions.

Two beams were subjected to a constant simulated service loading equal to 22.6% of undamaged (unheated) flexural strength, while the counterpart beams were exposed to fire without any applied sustained load. The test results showed that the bottom (tension) steel reinforcements in all fire-exposed beams had experienced the peak temperatures that were higher than a critical value (593\u00b0C [1099\u00b0F]) before the post-fire static test. The post-fire static test results showed that the sustained loading has a detrimental effect on the post-fire flexural response of RC beams. The effect was more pronounced on the post-fire stiffness and ductility than on strength.

The interfacial tension of PLA and NBR measured by contact angle measurement decreased as the acrylonitrile content of NBR decreased. Likewise, SEM images showed that the rubber particle size reduced with decreasing acrylonitrile content owing to the stronger interfacial adhesion between the PLA matrix and NBR domains. Incorporation of DCP at 1.0 phr for dynamic vulcanization led to higher crosslink density and, in turn, optimal tensile strength and tensile toughness as a result of the action of PLA-NBR copolymer as a reactive compatibilizer. The dynamic vulcanization of the blends containing low acrylonitrile NBR gave the most improved tensile properties because the free radicals from DCP decomposition preferentially attacked the allylic hydrogen atoms or double bonds of the butadiene backbone. Accordingly, more NBR macroradicals were generated and probably more PLA-NBR copolymers were produced. Moreover, further addition of DCP at 2.0 phr provided a large amount of crosslinked NBR gel, which significantly degraded the tensile properties. From the DSC results, dynamic vulcanization lowered the cold crystallization temperature, implying an improvement of cold crystallization. Finally, TGA results showed a higher degradation temperature as a function of DCP content, which suggested that thermal stability increased due to stronger interfacial adhesion as well as higher gel content. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Nanofibrous adsorbents are potential materials for such application with most attempts made on carbon nanofibers. In this study, a series of electrospun nanofibrous adsorbents containing amines were prepared using a 3-stage promising approach and tested comparatively for CO2 capture. The preparation of adsorbents involved electrospinning of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) solution, radiation-induced grafting (RIG) of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto electrospun nanofibers, and functionalization of poly-GMA grafted s-PP nanofibrous mats with different amines, including ethanolamine (EA) diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA). The effect of different amination parameters: namely, amine concentration, reaction time, temperature, and degree of grafting (DG) on the degree of amination (DA), was evaluated. The nanofibrous mats containing amine were tested for CO2 adsorption in a fixed bed column operated under various parameters such as amine density, amine type, initial CO2 concentration and temperature. The adsorbents recorded CO2 adsorption capacities of 2.87, 2.06, and 0.94 mmol/g for EA-, DEA- and TEA-containing adsorbents, respectively, at 30\u00b0C using initial CO2 concentration of 15%.

During the initial deposition stage (45\u201390 sec), low-coordinated small spherical Pt nanoparticles were formed.

        "Title": "Treatment of produced water mixed with polymer from petroleum production",
        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In the petroleum industry, polymer flooding is one of the main methods in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that applies a water-soluble polymer such as partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) to increase oil production. It is added to the flooding water to improve the oil movement. During the process, water is produced as a by-product along with oil and gas production. Moreover, produced water with polymer is more difficult to treat than that from conventional water-flooding process because it is complex and highly contaminated wastewater. The proper technology is required to treat this kind of wastewater and reuse it for oil production. Furthermore, the small to fine particles in the produced are needed to be removed because these particles can plug the reservoir in the oilfield. One of the main treatment processes is to apply the coagulant to agglomerate the fine particles and remove them before injection the water into the reservoir. Therefore, the objective of this study is to treat the produced water mixed with HPAM from petroleum production by using coagulants like polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and to investigate the effect of parameters such as coagulant dosage and polymer concentration on the treatment of produced water. The results are compared the performance with the conventional coagulant, potassium aluminum sulfate (potassium alum). The operating parameters of this study are coagulant dosage ranging from 300 to 900 mg/L and HPAM concentrations from 500 to 2,000 mg/L. In addition, the turbidity, as well as total suspended solids (TSS) are also studied. The results indicated that with an increase in HPAM concentration, the TSS and turbidity increase gradually under the same conditions. The results show that with 900 mg/L of coagulants, TSS and turbidity can be removed up to 89% and 94% with PAC and 39% and 27% with potassium alum, respectively. PAC can provide higher performance over alum at the same conditions; thus, leading to the reduction in chemical consumption and cost. Consequently, this method can be applied to use in the wastewater treatment from oil production with polymer flooding before injecting this produced water back into the reservoir.",

Some researches attempt to solve this problem using a carrier-based modulation with the addition of appropriate zero voltages. However, to find the equivalent carrier-based realization is not always easy, especially for those space-vector modulations which include dipolar switching mode. This paper proposes a systematic procedure to derive an equivalent carrier-based modulation for an arbitrary space-vector modulation by decomposition of voltage commands and addition of generalized zero voltages. The proposed procedure is based on two key mathematical concepts 1) the barycentric coordinates for space-vector calculation and 2) the generalized dipolar modulation concept. Experimental results are given to prove the correctness of the proposed carrier-based algorithm.",

Nearest Neighbor (NN) with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is regarded as one of the most effective and popular method used for a time series classification problem. Being a non-linear-alignment distance measure, DTW is known to function harmoniously with NN classifier as an effective tool in matching two time series sequences. However, despite the fact that DTW is specifically designed to discover an optimal alignment, it may not be able to achieve sensible local alignment. In this work, the shapeDTW framework was adopted in order to classify time series data based on the state-of-the-art HOG1D shape descriptor. Point-wise local structures were utilized in the alignment process; similarly-shaped structures are matched based on their levels of similarity. A generic alignment framework was provided by shapeDTW, which allows users to design the shape descriptors based on the data characteristics and domains. An enhanced shape descriptor representation called HOG1D-L was proposed based on two key concepts of the state-of-the-art HOG1D descriptor and linear regression. The proposed work on 84 UCR time series datasets was extensively tested and the results demonstrate that our approach can maintain or achieve better classification accuracy in most of the datasets.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Anchale Tresatayawed et al.The present study aims to investigate the catalytic ethanol dehydration to higher value products including ethylene, diethyl ether (DEE), and acetaldehyde. The catalysts used for this reaction were WO3/TiO2 catalysts having W loading of 13.5 wt.%. For a comparative study, the TiO2 supports employed were varied by two different preparation methods including the sol-gel and solvothermal-derived TiO2 supports, denoted as TiO2-SG and TiO2-SV, respectively. It is obvious that the different preparation methods essentially altered the physicochemical properties of TiO2 supports. It was found that the TiO2-SV exhibited higher surface area and pore volume and larger amounts of acid sites than those of TiO2-SG. As a consequence, different characteristics of support apparently affected the catalytic properties of WO3/TiO2 catalysts. As expected, both catalysts WO3/TiO2-SG and WO3/TiO2-SV exhibited increased ethanol conversion with increasing temperatures from 200 to 400\u00b0C. It appeared that the highest ethanol conversion (ca. 88%) at 400\u00b0C was achieved by the WO3/TiO2-SV catalysts due to its high acidity. It is worth noting that the presence of WO3 onto TiO2-SV yielded a remarkable increase in DEE selectivity (ca. 68%) at 250\u00b0C. In summary, WO3/TiO2-SV catalyst is promising to convert ethanol into ethylene and DEE, having the highest ethylene yield of ca. 77% at 400\u00b0C and highest DEE yield of ca. 26% at 250\u00b0C. These can be attributed to proper pore structure, acidity, and distribution of WO3.",

This research investigated the effects of framing on the people\u2019s perception of earthquake risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. There were three frames conveying the same earthquake risk but presented in different terms. These statements were in frequency terms of building damage: 475 severely damaged private buildings in 500 years, 10% chance of occurrence in 50 years, and one severely damaged private building per year. The objective of this research was to determine whether framing the same earthquake risk in different terms led to different perceptions of the risk by different people, leading to 1. what would be the most effective framing type regarding severely damaged private buildings, 2. which affected people\u2019s earthquake risk perception most, and 3. whether experiencing an earthquake disaster would change the risk perception of the residents. The result showed that presenting the risk as \u201cone severely damaged private building per year\u201d was the most commonly selected among the three frames and was statistically significant. This finding clarifies that short time frames influence people\u2019s earthquake risk decisions, and agencies can effectively use framing to communicate the earthquake risk to people in seismic regions to stimulate their earthquake preparedness and to reduce future earthquake risk. However, earthquake experience does not change the risk perception of the residents.",

By monitoring Twitter streams, we are able to detect emerging topics and understand events around the world. There are some prior attempts that aim to online detect topics on Twitter. However, they can only detect bursty topics by using user-defined keywords a long with simple rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect emerging topics on Twitter streams. To detect emerging topics, a clustering technique has been applied to aggregate a set of keywords. Since an emerging topic occurs continuously, the emerging topics are merged with stateful technique to accumulate topics from different time intervals. To detect both high signal topics and small-medium signal topics, we use statistical features based on average, acceleration, and z-score. Moreover, we propose to include the stock indicator features: Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH). They are common features in trend (oversold and overbought) detection in stock analysis which is similar to our topic detection in twitter. To capture any event patterns, Random Forest (RF) has been proposed as a classifier to detect emerging keywords by utilizing the stated above five features. To evaluate the performance, we created and published a corpus by collecting Twitter data for 10 days with over 80 million tweets and then labeling possible topics in tota1161 events along with related keywords. The experiment was conducted on our collected data. The Fl-results show that our model outperforms all baselines: TwitterMonitor, SigniTrend, and TopicSketch, in terms of detected keywords and topics.",

However, the accuracy is still limited since the raining period throughout the year in Thailand is very scarce, so most rainfall amount is zero.

Our network is a combination of CNN and GRU, where CNN aims to capture relationship between various sensors and GRU aims to capture time-series information.

This issue is particularly important for the degradation of toxic compound because the shifting in the pathway may result in intermediates having increased toxicity. Linuron, which is a toxic herbicide, is used as a model compound and zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as a catalyst. Two forms of ZnO having different exposing surfaces, i.e., conventional particles and nanorods are considered. It is experimentally shown and confirmed by molecular simulation that the adsorption and subsequent degradation are surface dependent. The adsorption capacity of linuron on polar surfaces of ZnO is much higher than that on non-polar surface. More importantly, alignments of linuron molecule adsorbing on different surfaces are different, leading to formation of different degradation intermediates. The degradation takes place on both aliphatic and aromatic sides when linuron adsorbs on polar surfaces whereas only the aliphatic part is attacked by hydroxyl radicals on the non-polar mixed terminated surface. The results in this work indicate that the exposing surface of the photocatalyst is the key factor in determining the degradation pathway and it should be considered in the catalyst design.

We measured formaldehyde removal rates at concentrations similar to those caused by new furniture or office photocopiers. We also measured CO2 and humidity changes, counted the stomata density and monitored leaf color and shape changes. Controls were an artificial polyester \u201cfern\u201d and methanol as the VOC. All plants reduced formaldehyde from 0.75 ppm to below 0.2 ppm in six hours. The plants fall into two major groups with different responses: one group showed high removal rates: Boston fern (0.85 m h\u22121), golden pothos (0.41 m h\u22121), Spanish moss (0.44 m h\u22121) and spider plant (0.40 m h\u22121) - faster than the artificial fern (0.09 m h\u22121). They also show no change in color and appear to completely assimilate formaldehyde. Another group absorbed formaldehyde at a significantly lower rate (dumb cane: 0.07 m h\u22121; aloe vera: 0.17 m h\u22121; and Chinese evergreen: 0.09 m h\u22121) and had a generally different overall behavior from the \u2018fast\u2019 group - different CO2, humidity and variance changes - suggesting a different formaldehyde absorption mechanism. An \u2018intermediate case\u2019, snake plant (0.29 m h\u22121), has a slower rate than the fast group but also exhibited other changes, suggesting some combination of both mechanisms. Overall good correlations between formaldehyde uptake rates and stomata counts, total leaf area and water evapotranspiration rates were shown by all these plants.",

The use of non-calcined Mg(Al)O-sv obtained from the solvothermal method led to the highest Pt dispersion, the lowest fraction of strong acid sites, and the lowest metallic tin species as well as coke content. Unlike the other catalysts that gradually deactivated with time-on-stream, the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv maintained high propylene yield \u02dc26.9% during 5 h reaction time without any sign of catalyst deactivation. The improved catalyst performances were attributed not only to the high surface area flower-like nanosheet structure of the Mg(Al)O-sv but also the uniform Mg-O-Al bonding and high Al/Mg atomic ratio on the catalyst surface as confirmed by the XPS results.",

This causes the challenges in energy market for EVs in terms of electricity costs and technical effects on distribution systems. This paper proposes a centralized market platform managed by a distribution system operator (DSO) to determine the appropriate and appealing electricity costs for charging an EV without violating the power system's limits: bus voltage level, line capacity, and transformer loading limits. To complete the operations of the centralized market platform, the EV power and the bidding price from each EV owner who wishes to participate in the centralized market platform are collected through a single auction. The electricity costs for charging an EV are calculated by taking into account the maximum EV power as determined by the DSO so that the power system' limits are not violated. This paper modifies and employs a Thailand-typical 380-V distribution test system during off-peak and peak hours for the case study. The results show that during off-peak hours, the electricity costs for charging an EV range between 2.40 and 2.50 THB/kWh, while during peak hours, the electricity costs range between 3.50 and 5.40 THB/kWh. The decrease in EV charging costs will encourage EV owners to utilize their EVs.",

Many geosynthetic materials have been developed to stabilise soil slopes while also being environmentally friendly and convenient for construction. In this study, the performance of a novel geosynthetic cementitious composite mat (GCCM) is studied regarding its ability to stabilise soil slopes. Physical model tests are performed on sandy soil slopes under seepage conditions both with and without GCCM stabilisation. Particle image velocimetry is used to measure the soil displacement, and standpipe piezometers are used to monitor the pore water pressure of the slope. The results show that the slope displacement with GCCM stabilisation is much smaller than that without it. The presence of the GCCM constrains the displacement near the slope surface to being along the slope, whereas without the GCCM the slope can deform freely especially in the middle to upper zone of slope area. The results indicate that the GCCM performs well at slope stabilisation.",

Several business process models were proposed to cope with the increasing risk and complexity of the supply chain operations and events, especially when the unexpected events, caused by the time dependent behaviors, occur. Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin.",

The design procedure combines finite-element (FE), genetic programming (GP), and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. An optimum patch design is defined as the combination of design parameters that simultaneously minimizes the patch volume and reduces the stress intensity factor (SIF) range below the fatigue threshold range. A patching correction factor, which accounts for the positive effects of material and geometric properties of the patch and adhesive layer on the SIF solution, is proposed. The correction factor is developed by performing symbolic regression via GP analyses on the SIF values obtained from the three-dimensional FE models. The closed-form SIF solution facilitates the visualization of the effects of design parameters, simplifies the calculation of fatigue life, and reduces the computation effort for design optimization. An example of the center-cracked steel plate subjected to constant amplitude fatigue loading and then repaired with double-sided adhesive-bonded FRP patches is used to illustrate the optimization procedure.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Nowadays, text classification is recognized as one of crucial tools for business users to gain more insights from customers. However, textual data from customers such as comments are usually short. Thus, there are two main issues in short text categorization: (1) insufficient contextual information and (2) noisy data due to misspellings. Recently, there is a prior attempt to propose a deep learning approach for short text categorization by expanding semantic using word embeddings clustering via an algorithm based on density peaks searching. Since the number of words in word embeddings is usually large, the clustering algorithm does not scale with the size of data set, thus demanding unacceptable computational cost. In this paper, we aim to propose a fast short-text categorization framework. Rather than using a CNN with k-max pooling layer, we propose to use a faster version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called 'multichannel CNN.' To speed up the semantic expansion process, we propose to employ mini batch K-Means++, which is considerably faster and scales well with the size of data set. Furthermore, we also introduce an additional preprocessing step to increase vocabulary coverage rate on word embeddings. We conducted experiments on four public data sets: Google Snippets, TREC, MR, and Subj. The results showed that the proposed framework does not only improve an accuracy on all data sets, but also reduces computational costs from several days to a few hours.",

The dataset for building estimator model is set of historical data of power generation from neighbor PV rooftops and distance between PV rooftops. We use ARIMA model to estimate transition matrix for running Kalman filter. The performance of the test is measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Skill Score (SS). The obtained result shows that ARIMA model has lower accuracy compared to Kalman filter and estimator model.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier LtdA solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (Uf), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in Uf decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand.",

The vigorous stirring inherently increased the temperature of the methanol-oil mixture to greater than 60 \u00b0C in less than 3 min, thus, a provision of external heating was not required. With a methanol to fresh refined palm oil molar ratio of 6:1 and 1 wt% sodium hydroxide catalyst, the FAME yield of 94.5% can be achieved in less than 3 min with the yield efficiency of 33.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 g/J for 500 mL of reaction volume.

Performances of NiFe-MgAl bifunctional catalysts, in terms of activity, stability, and regenerability, in chemical looping reforming (CLR) of ethanol were studied. The NiFe-MgAl bifunctional catalysts were prepared from hydrotalcite-like compounds by the co-precipitation method. Various characterization techniques, that is, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy, were used to determine properties of fresh and spent catalysts. In addition, O2 temperature-programmed oxidation, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman analyses were used for observation of coke formation on the spent catalysts. Meanwhile, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy can verify the evolution of the catalyst during the reactions. It was observed that the NiFe-MgAl catalyst showed higher catalytic activity and stability than the monometallic Fe-MgAl and Ni-MgAl catalysts. More specifically, the NiFe-MgAl catalyst provided the highest H2 concentration up to 80% at a low reaction temperature of 500 \u00b0C. This high performance was ascribed to the formation of Ni-Fe alloy particles. The combination of pulse experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis elucidated that the iron particle at the surface was in the form of FeO that can oxidize the carbon deposits, resulting in the suppression of coke formation.

The results present that with the formation characteristics, CO2 storage in this area has potential. Moreover, pressure buildup and plume migration are illustrated for the period of 50 years. As a fundamental knowledge, this study can contribute to CO2 storage in an offshore area in Thailand.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The destabilization mechanism of the high stable cutting-oil emulsion by aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) was investigated since it can affect properties of aggregates and following separation units. Al2(SO4)3 dosage and pH were key factors in the destabilization. The effective separation occurred when precipitated Al(OH)3 is dominated at the neutral pH of 6.5\u20137.0. The best separation can be achieved when solid flocs were formed at 1.0 mM, which exceeded the dosage from the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of 0.75 mM. Two different mechanisms were proved for the emulsion destabilization depending upon the Al3+ concentration under this pH range. The first mechanism was the adsorption of Al(OH)3 on surface of oil droplets, which led to the droplet coalescence. By increasing the Al3+ dosage, the sweep flocculation by Al(OH)3 precipitates occurred. Al3+ dosage for effective destabilization was increased in accordance with oil concentration. The formation of aluminum hydroxide precipitates in bayerite structure was affirmed by analyzing elemental composition and crystalline structure of flocs from the destablization.",

However, most space complexity reduction techniques for binary field multiplier are applicable for only optimal normal basis or Gaussian normal basis of even type. There are 187 binary fields GF 2k for k from 2 to 1,000 that use odd-type Gaussian normal basis. This paper presents a method to reduce the space complexity of odd-type Gaussian normal basis multipliers over binary field GF 2k. The idea is adapted from the matrix decomposition method for optimal normal basis. The result shows that our space complexity reduction method can reduce the number of XOR gates used in the implementation comparing to previous works with a small trade-off in critical path delay.",

By using SDN, virtual switches can be reprogrammed to drop attacker traffics at the earliest possible locations.

The testbed uses the GNS3 platform where OVS switches are constructed and controlled by the Opendaylight controller. A simple Linux script has been developed herein to instantiate a distributed ping attack from all possible starting switches to a victim gateway with the DDoS intention. The numerical example reported here shows TCP and UDP throughputs, round-trip time as measurable by emulated network users to demonstrate the application of SDN in resolving the attacking adverse effects.",

There are three main types of HAPs: a fixed wing aeroplane, an airship, and a balloon. This study aims at designing an unmanned solar-powered aeroplane for communication, functioning as a satellite. The values of solar radiation power on the equinox, summer solstice and winter solstice were estimated as well as a required power from each mission profile. Those values of the required power and the available one were used as constraints for a required solar cell area and a required battery capacity. Then, the wing planform was sized. To optimise the wing, three aerofoils with different tip dihedral angles were simulated with ANSYS so that the one with the optimal rolling, pitching and yawing moments could be selected. The mass of each aircraft component was later estimated, tail was sized based on those masses and their locations. The static margin was calculated to validate the tail sizing with the HAP centre of mass. The verification of power consumption was also performed by a simulation of the whole aircraft. The final conceptual HAP model is equipped with 19.5-aspect-ratio Eppler 397 wing with an angle of incidence of 5 degrees and tip dihedral angle of 8 degree at 7.5 metres from the longitudinal centre line.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The presence of multiple contaminant species in surface waters makes surface water treatment difficult to accomplish through a single process. Herein, we evaluated the ability of an integrated adsorption/ultrafiltration (UF) membrane filtration system to simultaneously remove phosphates and dissolved organic matter (DOM). When bare powdered activated carbon (PAC) and PAC impregnated with amorphous ferrihydrite (FHPAC) adsorbents were compared, FHPAC showed a greater adsorption rate and capacity for phosphate. FHPAC had a phosphate adsorption capacity of 2.32 mg PO43\u2212/g FHPAC, even when DOM was present as a competing adsorbate. In a lab-scale hybrid FHPAC-UF system (i.e. integrated adsorption by FHPAC with UF membrane filtration), irreversible membrane fouling was ca. three times lower than that in a PAC-UF system. When membrane fouling in the PAC-UF system was described with pore blockage models, we found that the main cause of fouling was bacterial deposition on the membrane surface. CLSM analysis determined that the chemical composition of foulants in the PAC-UF system included higher proportions of proteins, nucleic acids, and alpha-polysaccharides than that in the FHPAC-UF system. Overall, FHPAC\u2019s ability to undergo ligand exchanges with DOM helped to reduce the nutrients and bacteria that cause biofouling to accumulate on the membrane surface.",

The representative data selection simulation is one of the evaluation methods providing practical results with reasonable computational resources. However, it is mostly used in the domestic radiation effect evaluation. This study investigated and modified this simulation method for transboundary radiation effect evaluation. The effects of selected area boundaries, optional weather parameters, and sampling rate, critical parameters in the representative data selection scheme, are sequentially investigated on the calculated results. The evaluation is performed by Nuclear Accident Consequence Analysis Code (NACAC) with hypothetical accidents at Fangchenggang NPP in China. It is revealed that area boundary and optional weather parameter selection insignificantly impact the predicted results, but the sampling rate condition affects the predicted results. Good agreements comprising dispersion characteristics and total effective dose equivalent by simulation using representative and sequential data selections are shown with absolute mean bias error lower than 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 mSv, root mean square error lower than 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 mSv, and correlation coefficient value higher than 9.1 \u00d7 10\u22121.",

The morphological and chemical characteristics of the sulfonated HTCDRB catalyst were also examined. In addition, the stability of the catalyst was evaluated based on the amounts of biomass conversion products (5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, levulinic acid and formic acid) leached into water at a specified biomass conversion condition. Since no HMF and furfural, and only small amounts of levulinic acid (1.75 wt.%), and formic acid (0.42 wt.%), were leached from the catalyst synthesized from HTCDRB prepared at the carbonization condition of 220 \u00b0C for 3 h, this condition was suggested to be a suitable carbonization condition. Despite having similar structural and chemical characteristics, the leaching test suggested that the DRB-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst was found to be more stable than the glucose-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst, prepared at the same condition. The catalytic activity for cellulose hydrolysis of the catalyst was higher than that of the commercial Amberlyst 16 WET catalyst.",

Two temperature-dependent desorption regimes, common to all surfaces, are identified. The low-temperature desorption regime spatially limited to the vicinity of some Au nanoparticles (NPs) is catalytically enhanced, resulting in oxide pinholes which expand laterally into macro holes many times the size of the catalyzing NPs and with shapes dictated by the underlying crystallography. The high-temperature desorption regime causes homogeneous oxides thinning and, ultimately, complete oxide desorption. The temperature difference between the two regimes is \u223c25 \u00b0C-60 \u00b0C. After oxide desorption and depending on Au size and GaAs surface orientation, Au particles may dissolve the fresh GaAs surface and form mobile AuGa2/Ga core/shell units, or form stationary AuGa2 crystallites, or the catalyzing Au particles may run with minimal reaction with the GaAs surface.

Several past studies in recent years independently showed that the reduction on the SIF of cracked structures after the patch repair is dependent on many factors such as bonding techniques, material parameters, geometric parameters, environmental factors. In this study, the SIF of the repaired cracked steel plate was considered to be a function of seven parameters including the crack length, elastic modulus of FRP material, shear modulus of adhesive material, dimensions (width, length, and thickness) of rectangular FRP patches, and thickness of adhesive layers. Empirical SIF equations were created by the data mining process of genetic programming analyses performed on a database created from the FE results. The SIF values obtained from these equations were also compared with an analytical equation to assess whether their ability to perform well on a certain design or not. It was found that the proposed SIF equations fitted well with the FE results as the squared Pearson correlation coefficients R2 are higher than 0.9. In addition, the correlations between proposed equations and the analytical equation are approximately 0.8.",

Improving the quality of state variable feedback under the lack of global positioning is imperative for enhancing the motion control performance. This paper proposes an alternative method of wheel slip angle estimation requiring only on-board measurement. The kinematics-based analytical solution is derived so that the slip angle of any free-rolling wheel can be estimated from the measured information of the wheel rolling speed and steering angle, along with the yaw rate and the linear accelerations of the mobile platform. The complete estimation of state variables: traveling speed, sideslip and radius of curvature is obtained from kinematic relationships. An experimental prototype of planar mobile platform is modified from a scaled RWD vehicle with free-rolling front wheel. During extremely sliding random motion, the estimated wheel slip angle and state variables are validated with the motion captured data. This proposed estimation technique can be applied for motion control applications of wheeled mobile robots and automobiles.",

The different inoculation promoted operational performance, stability, and organic loading rate (OLR) differently. The produced biogas and methane varied significantly with OLR (p < 0.05). The maximum gas productivities between 0.42\u20130.48 L-biogas/g VSadded and 0.27\u20130.34 L-CH4/g VSadded were obtained at OLR of 1.0\u20131.5 g VS/L day.

These controversies have arisen partly because there have been significant misunderstandings of some of the proposed mechanisms, and some misinterpretation of experimental observations. There has also been a lack of consideration of all the evidence, with some researchers ignoring observations that do not fit their favoured hypothesis. Some recent reviews and papers illustrating the above points are discussed in the present paper, although a comprehensive coverage is not attempted. It is concluded that the adsorption-induced dislocation-emission/void-coalescence mechanism predominates for cleavage-like and intergranular fracture modes that exhibit microscale or nanoscale dimples. Hydrogen-enhanced decohesion, hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity, and vacancy-based mechanisms may play secondary roles for such fracture modes and could be more important in other cases.",

In this paper, the lower bound (LB) finite element limit analysis in conjunction with semidefinite programming (SDP) is developed and employed to investigate the stability of plane strain tunnel headings in Hoek-Brown (HB) rock masses. Lower bound solutions of the load factor of the problem for the practical ranges of dimensionless parameters are extensively examined including the cover-depth ratio of headings, the normalized uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock, the Geological Strength Index (GSI), and the HB material constant (mi). The failure mechanisms associated with those parameters are discussed and compared. The safety assessment of relatively long-wall tunnels or mining in rock masses can be reliably and accurately performed by employing the presented results in practice.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.To achieve water reuse in recirculating aquaculture systems, intermittent nitrification and denitrification processes using internal fibrous media was proposed. A pre-acclimated Biocord biofilter, with an initial nitrification rate of 17.1 \u00b1 12.4 mg total ammonia nitrogen-N/m2/d was applied in a marine whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) culture tank. Throughout the experiment, the aerobic nitrification activity of the biofilter was sufficient to control the ammonia and nitrite levels below 0.2 mg-N/L with an accumulation of nitrate up to 50 mg-N/L. The remaining nitrate was successfully removed after shrimp harvest with the same biofilter through anoxic denitrification in conjunction with a methanol supplement at a chemical oxygen demand: nitrate-N ratio of 5:1. With complete nitrogen removal, the water was re-aerated and the next crop of shrimp culture was initiated. In this study, a two-crop shrimp cultivation was performed in sequence in the same tank without water exchange. The microbial diversity was monitored using high-throughput sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, which demonstrated that Proteobacteria (45.3 %), Chloroflexi (18.4 %), and Bacteroidetes (17.1 %) were the most abundant phyla. With an emphasis on nitrogen removal, the family Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae were the dominant nitrifying bacteria during the aerobic nitrification, while a high relative abundance of the Methylophaga and Methylotenera genera was observed under the anoxic condition.",

All rights reserved.A protective ballistic armor used for military buildings, that will meet the anti-terrorism and force protection demands, are increasingly needed, particularly in Thailand's southernmost provinces. A new type of ballistic armor system has been developed, composing of composite layers, using natural rubber reinforced with steel wire mesh, and Al plate. The composite layers were used as front material while the Al plate was used as backing plate. The armors were tested against NIJ-Type III threats using NIJ 0108.01 ballistic test standard. The armor, with 12 mm Al backing plate, can successfully resist the NIJ-Type III treat with only combination of two composite layers. Different than hard and brittle plate, such as ceramic, the use of composite layer at the front did not blunt and erode the projectile, due to its ductile property. However, the composite layer effectively reduces the velocity of projectile, due to high fracture toughness, as a result of reinforcing steel wire mesh layers in the composites. The projectile was finally stopped by the Al backing plate.",

Utilization of hydrogen available as a by-product from other processes may resolve such issue. In this work; therefore, we evaluate the potentiality of incorporating the hydrogen by-product from the NaOCH3 production for the synthesis of methanol via hydrogenation of CO2, a greenhouse gas released from industry. Due to the limited availability of hydrogen from NaOCH3 production, a detailed analysis of kinetic in the reactor systems including, 1) the adiabatic fixed bed, 2) the isothermal multi-tube, and 3) the adiabatic fixed-bed reactors with an intercooler, are simulated using Aspen Plus in order to select the most appropriate reactor system that maximizes the conversion of hydrogen and CO2. The adiabatic fixed bed reactor appears the most appropriate since it consumes the highest amount of CO2, and shows the highest Profitability Index when compared to other reactor systems. In addition, methanol produced from this proposed process can provide a 16.4% reduction in the methanol feedstock required for the upstream process of NaOCH3 production. An analysis using Aspen Economic is also performed in this work which reveals that the saving cost generated from the recycle of methanol to the upstream process is almost comparable to the costs of construction and operation of the process of methanol synthesis. According to our useful sensitivity analysis, a methanol price as well as hydrogen and CO2 feed rates directly influenced the feasibility of the proposed process. The obtained result indicates that this proposed process is potentially feasible when 1) the price of methanol increases, and 2) the availability of hydrogen increases due to the increased NaOCH3 production capacity over than 1.5 times of the current scale.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019Heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction has been generally applied for degradation of toxic contaminants. Degradations of a compound using the same kind of catalyst that was synthesized differently are commonly found in literature. However, the reported degradation intermediates are normally inconsistent. This issue is especially important for the degradation of toxic compounds because intermediates may be more toxic than their parent compounds and understanding the reason is necessary if appropriate catalysts are to be designed. This work systematically compares the photocatalytic degradation of diuron, a toxic recalcitrant herbicide, on two forms of zinc oxide (ZnO), i.e., conventional particles with zinc- and oxygen-terminated polar surfaces as the dominating planes, and nanorods with mixed-terminated nonpolar surfaces. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that both the rate of reaction and the degradation pathway depend on the adsorption configuration of diuron onto the surface. Diuron molecules adsorb in different alignments on the two surfaces, contributing to the formation of different degradation intermediates. Both the aliphatic and aromatic sides of diuron adsorb on the polar surfaces simultaneously, leading to an attack by hydroxyl radicals from both ends. On the other hand, on the mixed-terminated surface, only the aliphatic part adsorbs and is degraded. The exposed surface is therefore the key factor controlling the degradation pathway. For diuron degradation on ZnO, a catalyst confined to mixed-terminated surfaces, i.e., ZnO nanorods, is more desirable, as it avoids the formation of intermediates with potent phytotoxicity and cytogenotoxicity.",

Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are used to find a set of optimal (or non-dominated) solutions.

As the annual profit demonstrates the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost (ACC) indicates availability of investments, the MOO of the integrated plant is performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions based on the minimization of ACC and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variables. After that, ten selection methods are used to recommend practical solutions for implementing in the integrated plant. In order to explore the effect of decision variables uncertainty on obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, random variations in decision variables are used to quantify deviations in objective functions.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier LtdPhotocatalytic treatment of organic pollutants present in wastewater using semiconductor nanomaterials under light irradiation is one of the efficient advanced oxidation processes. Stable metal oxide (e.g. TiO2) based semiconductor photocatalytic systems have been mainly investigated for this purpose. Nevertheless, their large band gap (~3.2 eV) makes them inefficient in utilization of visible light portion of solar light leading to a lower degradation efficiency. Investigations have focused on the development of visible light responsive bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX; X = Cl, Br, I), one of the potential nanomaterials with unique layered structure, for efficient absorption of solar light for the degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers limits their practical applicability. To overcome such drawbacks, the development of BiOX based ternary nanocomposites received significant attention because of their unique structural and electronic properties, improved visible light response and increased separation and transfer rate of photogenerated charge carriers. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments on bismuth oxyhalides-based ternary nanocomposites for enhanced environmental pollutants decomposition under visible light irradiation. The principles of photocatalysis, synthetic methodologies of bismuth oxyhalides and their characteristics such as heterojunctions formation, improved visible light response and separation rate of charge carriers and the mechanisms for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity are discussed. In addition, the future prospects on the improvement in the photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxyhalides-based ternary nanocomposites are also discussed. This review could be beneficial for designing new ternary nanocomposites with superior visible light photocatalytic efficiency.",

To investigate and explain the topological evolution of BRTN from 1999 to 2029, five network indicators were selected, including network diameter, gamma index, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. We found that, as the BRTN evolves, both diameter and gamma index seemingly rise indicating better spread and connectivity over time. Likewise, average degree centrality increases from 1.91 to 2.27, while both average closeness and betweenness centrality gradually decline; but with different intensity patterns. More specifically, stations with high closeness tend to be those in the central Bangkok area as they conveniently reach the rest of the network with fewer links; however, as betweenness gives more weights to stations that facilitate transportation, stations with high betweenness tend to be those joining central area to the suburbs.",

This paper has reported on our first-step findings towards the development of a tool to help checking the feasibility of SDN technology in smart grid applications. Since the smart grid applications must be delay-critical, timing performances become essential and all the modules to be used in the tool development must be verified on that aspect. Particularly, for this paper, Mininet and ONOS controller have been tested.

Build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-transfer-operate (BTO) are two of commonly used PPP contracts for transportation infrastructure, in which the private (or the concessionaire) is responsible for the risks relating to the design, finance, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project. As some of PPP transportation infrastructure projects in Thailand are approaching its final year of a concession period, decision as to extend or to end the contract must be made by a contracting agency, that is: (1) to extend the concession contract to the existing concessionaire for a certain period of years or (2) to let the concession expire and to have a responsible public agency assume the operation. This paper is to propose a decision-making model based on a level of risk exposure as a computational tool for comparing between a renewal package offered by the concessionaire and expected benefits generated under the operation by the public agency. A case study project, a BOT elevated road located in Bangkok, will be used to illustrate the application of the proposed model.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate two operational modes of the worker allocation problem (WAP) in the multiple U-line system (MULS). Five objectives are optimised simultaneously for the most complicated operational modes, i.e. machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking. Besides, the benefits of using multiline workstations (MLWs) are investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The elite non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III (ENSDE III) algorithm is developed as a solution technique. Also, the largest remaining available time heuristic is proposed as a baseline in determining the number and utilisation of workers when the use of MLWs is not allowed. Findings: ENSDE III outperforms the cutting-edged multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III, under two key Pareto metrics, i.e. generational distance and inverted generational distance, regardless of the problem size. The best-found number of workers from ENSDE III is substantially lower than the upper bound. The MULS with MLWs requires fewer workers than the one without. Research limitations/implications: Although this research has extended several issues in the basic model of multiple U-line systems, some assumptions were used to facilitate mathematical computation as follows. The U-line system in this research assumed that all lines were produced only a single product. Besides, all workers were well-trained to gain the same skill. These assumptions could be extended in the future. Practical implications: The implication of this research is the benefits of multiline workstations (MLWs) used in the multiple U-line system. Instead of leaving each individual line to operate independently, all lines should be working in parallel through the use of MLWs to gain benefits in terms of worker reduction, balancing worker\u2019s workload, higher system utilisation. Originality/value: This research is the first to address the WAP in the MULS with machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking modes. Worker\u2019s fatigue due to standing and walking while working is incorporated into the model. The novel ENSDE III algorithm is developed to optimise the multi-objective WAP in a Pareto sense. The benefits of exploiting MLWs are also illustrated.",

Therefore, the investigation of cell viability in a setup of spiral microchannel including feeding system and spiral microchannel was performed in this work. Beside the cell viability investigation, the change in cell morphology and intracellular structures were also investigated. The results indicated that stresses - extensional and shear stresses might be the important factors affecting cell death.

Its effect on a stability problem during undrained loading should be considered in order to get a more accurate and realistic safety assessment. In this paper, the undrained stability of unlined square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays is investigated by the lower bound finite element limit analysis using second-order cone programming. The anisotropic undrained strength of clays is modelled by using an elliptical strength envelope under plane strain conditions. The stability analyses of the problem are performed by the comprehensive investigations of the effects of the cover-depth ratio, the normalized overburden pressure, the normalized strength gradient, and the anisotropic strength ratio on the stability load factor and associated failure mechanisms. The computed lower bound solutions are validated with the existing results of square tunnels in isotropic clays. The new approximate equations of the stability load factor and factor of safety for square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays are first time presented by using a nonlinear regression, hence providing a reliable, accurate and convenient tool for stability analyses of the problem in practice. The numerical results reveal that the strength anisotropy has a significant impact on the stability load factor, especially when anisotropic clays have much difference in undrained strengths between compression and extension.",

The studied amines includes ethanolamine (MEA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), diisopropylamine (DIPA) and aminoethylpiperazine (AEP). Regardless of amine type, in the absence of a bicarbonate solution, no reduction/oxidation peaks were observed. However, in the presence of bicarbonate, a single reduction peak along with simultaneous H2 evolution was clearly observed. The cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that only diisopropylamine (DIPA) had a significant catalytic effect toward bicarbonate reduction on the composite electrode. No peak was observed in the anodic direction of the reverse scans, suggesting the irreversible nature of the electrochemical process. The effect of scan rate revealed that the irreversible reduction mechanism is governed by both diffusion and adsorption pathways. In addition of carbonate ions, format ions also have been detected in liquid phase. In order to study the mechanism of bicarbonate reduction in the DIPA solution on Ag2O/CNT electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. The EIS results showed that the charge transfer resistance decreased when the potential decreased from -0.1 to -0.9 V then faded with a further rise in potential to up to -1.9 V.

To investigate the formation of the alpha-case layer during the casting of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy, both metal ingots were cast in spinel-based investments in a controlled environment.

The samples were characterized using light microscopy, Vickers microhardness testing, X-ray diffractometry, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrometry. The alpha-case layer on the CP-Ti cast sample was thicker than that of the Ti-6Al-4V cast sample due to the ability of the \u03b1-titanium matrix to uptake oxygen faster, which in turn is attributed to the higher diffusion coefficient of the \u03b1-titanium phase.

A high voltage function generator power supply was operated at various frequencies and it was also used for DC operation. The electron temperatures were measured by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) technique for different operating pressures of 0.1 mbar, 0.6 mbar and 1.1 mbar. For the simulation, both plasma theory and finite element method were used to simulate dynamics of the plasma in the cylindrical setup. From the experiment, the range of breakdown voltage was found to be between 0.80 to 2.3 kV. The length of DC glow discharge dark regions of the plasma decreases due to increasing in both operating pressure and voltage. AC glow discharge shows positive charge and negative charge swing.

The RAS integrated with filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter provided complete nitrification without solid accumulation. Under the optimal treatment condition for 16 d, the treated water was low in ammonia (0 mg-N/L) and high in nitrate (> 6 mg-N/L) concentrations, which was appropriate for use in the cultivation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The RAS was then incorporated with hydroponics at a 5:1 fish: plant weight ratio. Moreover, the simplified APS was compared with a typical APS system that incorporated filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter. The natural growth of nitrifying microorganisms in the simplified APS could perform complete nitrification after 20 d of operation giving low ammonia and nitrite concentrations. The nutrient removal efficiency of the simplified APS resembled the typical system.

For a range of possible web cracks in typical hot-rolled W shapes listed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual, the effective mode-I SIF is a function of applied stress, web crack length, crack eccentricity, and flange-to-web area ratio of the W shape. The depth-to-width ratio of W shape is not a significant parameter in the calculation of SIF. The analysis results show that the conventional (overlapping) solution underestimates the SIF at the tension-side crack tip under bending up to 12%.

For content-based filtering, this paper proposes using regression to create a prediction model from customer and restaurant characteristics. For collaborative filtering, our proposed model employs a combination of cluster analysis, similarity test, and weighted sum in order to analyze factors that influence the satisfaction rating. Cluster analysis helps to reduce the impact of sparsity in collaborative filtering. Subsequently, hybrid filtering is proposed to combine the results from the two techniques above to generate the final rating.

Structural models, including diaphragm wall, diagonal braces, and bored piles, were the focus of study, which indicates that the types of elements used to model the structure system significantly affect the finite element analysis result.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020 Elsevier LtdAn innovative seawater uranium adsorbent was prepared from the low-cost and commercially-available polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The optimum condition to synthesize the adsorbent was to irradiate the PAN fibers with 100 kGy gamma ray, amidoximate in 3 (w/v)% hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution for 75 min at 75 \u00b0C, yielding the PAN nitrile group conversion of approximately 60%. At 100 kGy, the degree of crystallinity of the irradiated fibers was also highest at 79.1%. The performances of the adsorbent in seawater samples were excellent. By submersion in the seawater sample spiked with 250 ppb of uranium for 4 weeks, the prepared fibers exhibited the adsorption capacity of 32.28 mg/g adsorbent. By submersion in seawater samples spiked with 76.5 ppm of uranium for 1 week and 945 ppm of uranium for up to 4 weeks, the fibers exhibited the adsorption capacities of 111.25 and 200.07 mg/g adsorbent, respectively. The adsorbent showed a uranium adsorption capacity of 0.11 mg/g adsorbent for 8 weeks of soaking in brine concentrate from a seawater reverse osmosis plant. The kinetics of seawater absorption by the adsorbent was quite rapid, reaching the equilibrium swelling ratio of approximately 300% in 5 min or less. Another important finding was that the prepared PAN fibers exhibit the characteristics of a superabsorbent material (equilibrium swelling ratio in DI water of 5,550%). The low cost and the ease of preparation of the fibers offer a novel environmental remediation process to adsorb uranium ions released into seawater following a nuclear accident.",

The finite element concept was used to discretize the soil mass into 3-noded triangular elements. The stress field was modeled using a linear interpolation within the elements while stress discontinuities were permitted to occur at the shared edges of adjacent elements. An elliptical yield criterion was adopted to model the anisotropic undrained strength of the clay. A statically admissible stress field was defined by enforcing the equilibrium equations within all triangular elements and along all shared edges of adjacent elements, stress boundary conditions, and no stress violation of the anisotropic strength envelope cast in the form of a conic quadratic constraint. The lower bound solution of the proposed formulation was solved by second-order cone programming. The proposed formulation of the anisotropic undrained strength criterion was validated through comparison of the model's predictions with the known exact solutions of strip footings, and was applied to solve undrained stability of a shallow unlined square tunnel. Computational performance between the proposed approach of second-order cone programming and linear programming was examined and discussed.",

KGaA, WeinheimThe dimensions and morphologies of quantum nanostructures are keys to controlling an operating wavelength to a desirable wavelength range due to the quantum effect. The dimension and morphology evolutions of InSb/InAs quantum nanostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy with respect to the number of InSb monolayers (MLs) are investigated. The formation of the quantum nanostructures is dominated by lateral growth, in which the morphology is further elongated as the number of MLs is increased. Such an anisotropic growth is explained by the difference in the surface energy along each direction, which corresponds to different atomic arrangements in the crystalline structure of InSb. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic images show a reduction in the lateral dimension and an increase in the height of the embedded InSb quantum nanostructures when they are embedded in the InAs matrix. The results herein provide a means for obtaining the precise control over dimensions and morphologies of the InSb/InAs nanostructures, which is essential for extending the operating wavelength further into the mid-infrared region.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier LtdSince the manual detection of electrographic seizures in continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is very time-consuming and requires a trained expert, attempts to develop automatic seizure detection are diverse and ongoing. Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this problem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount of data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features, data transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and classify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied features used in the classification may have shared similar contributions, making them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in characterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review classification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of feature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each feature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability distribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the individual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based feature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features \u2013 variance, energy, nonlinear energy, and Shannon entropy computed on a raw EEG signal, as well as variance, energy, kurtosis, and line length calculated on wavelet coefficients \u2013 were able to significantly capture the seizures. When compared with a baseline method of classifying all epochs as normal, an improvement of 4.77\u201313.51% in the Bayesian error was obtained.",

Specifically, the time activity curves were extracted from the DAS data of 18 healthy volunteers and subjected to FT and HHT analyses. Comparison of the mean, standard deviation (SD), and root mean square error (RMSE) of ACR estimated by both methods showed that the proposed HHT method yielded significantly smaller SD (p<0.00001), smaller relative SD (13.3% versus 53.7%) and RMSE (0.72 cpm versus 1.59 cpm). Moreover, the HHT method also achieved lower relative SD of the frequency values from the intrinsic mode functions. Overall results indicated that the HHT method outperformed the conventional FT method in estimating the ACR from DAS. We anticipate that our approach will lead to development of effective noninvasive diagnoses of gastrointestinal tract diseases using DAS.",

Attributed to high carbon content of eucalyptus oil, CNTs with substantial yield could be produced within a pyrolyzing temperature (Tp) range of 800\u2212900 \u00b0C and different molar ratios of eucalyptus oil to ferrocene (Rof) including 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1. Typical FESEM analyses of as-produced CNTs revealed that CNTs with agglomeration of amorphous carbon could be produced at low Tp and low Rof. Meanwhile higher Tp and Rof could provide CNTs with lower content of amorphous carbon. TGA analyses could confirm the superior thermal stability of the resultant CNTs which were produced at high Tp and Rof. The highest CNT yield of about 45 % was obtained at Tp of 850 \u00b0C and Rof of 1:1.

An automatic food categorization application would greatly help to identify and classify food categories. Food categorization is a complex problem since the number of category types can be more than one hundred. Many kinds of food are similar with only subtle differences in taste and presentation and this can lead to a problem called 'finegrained issue'. Recently, a bilinear model was employed which showed good accuracy and generated excessive features to capture details among different food categories, albeit with limited performance. Diverse food categories require disparate sets of features. Here, an attention mechanism was applied to capture suitable features and specifically identify each food category. Furthermore, the performance of a bilinear backbone was also enhanced by applying Inception in correlation with Inception-ResNet-v2 and Inception-v3 networks.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 by the authors.In the remote sensing domain, it is crucial to complete semantic segmentation on the raster images, e.g., river, building, forest, etc., on raster images. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder (DCED) network is the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method for remotely sensed images. However, the accuracy is still limited, since the network is not designed for remotely sensed images and the training data in this domain is deficient. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel CNN for semantic segmentation particularly for remote sensing corpora with three main contributions. First, we propose applying a recent CNN called a global convolutional network (GCN), since it can capture different resolutions by extracting multi-scale features from different stages of the network. Additionally, we further enhance the network by improving its backbone using larger numbers of layers, which is suitable for medium resolution remotely sensed images. Second, \"channel attention\" is presented in our network in order to select the most discriminative filters (features). Third, \"domain-specific transfer learning\" is introduced to alleviate the scarcity issue by utilizing other remotely sensed corpora with different resolutions as pre-trained data. The experiment was then conducted on two given datasets: (i) medium resolution data collected from Landsat-8 satellite and (ii) very high resolution data called the ISPRS Vaihingen Challenge Dataset.

Design/methodology/approach: The prior maintenance strategy was reviewed, and then the strategy was adjusted to focus on PaM. Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) was a tool for analyzing the severity and occurrence of the failure modes and effects. Then, the Why\u2012Why analysis was used for investigating the root causes of failures. The countermeasures were drawn, and the preventive maintenance (PM) plan was revised and carried out. The total maintenance, the PaM and reactive maintenance workload, was obtained, and then the improvements were determined. The values of availability were also obtained. Findings: Previously, the appeared maintenance strategy was not clearly defined. It seemed to have reactive maintenance coupled with PM; it was checked once a year, and corrective actions were made when something wrong was found. Then the management team observed an increase in the reactive maintenance workload, whereas the values of availability were not consistent and tended to drop. After implementing the new maintenance strategy, PaM, the total maintenance workload decreased 14 percent in one year. The average availability of the solar power plant improved from 0.9943 to 0.9969, and the values of availability had better consistency. Practical implications: The PaM can be applied to solar power plant without limiting the prior maintenance strategy and the complexity of production or machinery. The solar power plant is a quite simple production, and most machines consist of electrical equipment and electrical circuits. The PaM supports to analyze the failure modes, the consequence of the failure events and failure effects, and to decide what should be done. Importantly, PaM can reduce total maintenance workload while the value of availability is higher and consistent. Originality/value: This paper states how to successfully implement the PaM for the solar power plant. Previously, the plant did not have a clearly defined maintenance strategy; it was checked once a year, and it was corrected when abnormalities were detected. The PaM strategy provides tools and processes for failures and effects analysis. Although there was a more workload of PM, the total maintenance workload decreased, even in the first year.",

This study should offer an alternative powerful tool essential for the modeling of both near-surface and deeply embedded defects in a rock/soil medium. A system of governing equations is established using a pair of weakly singular, weakform, displacement and traction integral equations for the cracked whole space along with the symmetric condition. The final equations contain only unknown crack-face data in a lowerhalf of the whole space. In addition to their capability to treat cracks of arbitrary shape, material anisotropy and general loading conditions, all involved kernels are weakly singular allowing all integrals to be interpreted in the sense of Riemann. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the Galerkin approximation is implemented to solve the governing integral equations for the unknown crack-face data. To further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme, special basis functions are introduced to approximate the near-front field and the interpolation technique is adopted to evaluate all kernels for generally anisotropic materials. The solved crack-face displacement data is then utilized to postprocess for the essential fracture information along the crack front. Various scenarios are employed to verify the proposed technique and a selected set of results is presented to demonstrate its accuracy and computational robustness.",

The effects of electrode composition, electrolyte concentration and the scan rate (10\u2013250 mV/s) were investigated at a temperature of 27 \u00b0C. An optimum mass ratio of 70/30 (Ag2O/CNT) led to a maximum current density of 83 mA cm\u22122 at \u22120.43 V (VS Ag/AgCl). At scan rates between 10 and 250 mV/s, a negative shift with a displacement of around 1.032 V was observed \u2013 indicating the presence of irreversible reduction reactions. The observed irreversibility suggested that the reaction mechanism can be described by both diffusion and adsorption phenomena. The standard heterogeneous rate constant (ko) and the formal redox potential (Eo) were found to be 1.51 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm/s and 1.218 V, respectively. The EIS results confirmed the formation of the inductive loops at reduction potentials \u2013 a consequence of the adsorption of the generated species. A reduction in charge transfer resistance and a continual drop in the potential from \u22120.1 down to \u22121.4 V was also observed. This was accompanied by H2 evolution and bicarbonate production. The calculated pKa value of 10.20 upon the completion of the bicarbonate reduction reactions, confirmed the conversion of bicarbonate to carbonate ions.",

However, the SESR process is discontinuous and requires regeneration after sorbent saturation with CO2. The circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFBR) system has previously been proposed for continuous H2 production, with both reforming and sorbent regeneration occurring simultaneously. The main aim of this work was to determine the feasibility and performance of SESR with a proper design and conditions in conjunction with the CFBR system. The reforming riser and bubbling bed regenerator are studied separately but related to each other. Two-dimensional transient models using the Euler\u2012Euler approach and kinetic theory of granular flow were used for fluid dynamic simulations combined with the decarbonation kinetics of dolomite, to investigate a conceptual regenerator system and determine its key conditions. A mixture of the Ni-based catalyst and dolomite from the risers was injected with a flux of 200 kg/(m2 s) and a catalyst to sorbent ratio of 2.54 kg/kg. A double-stage bubbling bed regenerator system was designed with 1.2 m width, 0.8 m bed height, a gas inlet velocity of 0.2 m/s and solid preheating at 950 \u00b0C. The used dolomite was regenerated with an assumed CaO conversion of 3%; the almost fresh dolomite was then released with good mixing of the catalyst and sorbent.",

Combining the Operando DRIFTS with gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (Operando DRIFTS-GC-FID) technique and in situ DRIFTS-TPD led to more deeply understanding of the correlation of acid sites and the primary cross metathesis reaction as the main reaction with isomerization of trans-2-butene as the side reaction. The adsorption energy of pulse chemisorption of 1-butene on catalyst by in situ DSC, confirmed the presence of the Lewis acid site type II related to the opportunity of 1-butene adsorption. The results confirmed that the Lewis acid site at 1620 cm\u22121 was crucial for the secondary metathesis reaction of 1-butene.",

The contact surface between the plate and the half-space is assumed to be smooth, and the deflected shape of the plate is represented by a power series of the radial coordinate. The undetermined coefficients in the series are determined through the minimization of the total potential energy functional of the plate-half-space system.

The %yield of total reducing sugar (TRS) and glucose were calculated by DNS method and glucose assay kit, respectively. The chemical structure, morphology, and crystal structure of plasma-treated CSW were investigated. The results showed that the %yield of TRS was greatly enhanced by SPP treatment compared to that of acid hydrolysis. The CSW powder completely broke down into pieces after SPP treatment was applied.

As cities constantly evolve, keeping an up-To-date map of POIs is difficult. However, by observing digital footprints of people, including taxi pick-up and drop-off locations, we can detect hotspots of activities that indicate POI locations by using techniques such as point clustering. DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm for geographic data points. However, the effectiveness of the algorithm relies on determining appropriate parameters that match the distribution pattern of data points. That is hard because pick-up and drop-off locations are distributed differently in different areas. This paper proposes a method to automatically determine the parameters of DBSCAN according to point distribution in each dataset. The algorithm has been applied to pick-up and drop-off locations of taxis in Bangkok. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively discovered POIs in areas with different distribution patterns.",

Several existing mechanisms for enhancing were proposed in the traditional network not only at the application side as video clients but also at the network core as network routers. Although, these mechanisms can provide a good quality of service, they require a lot of maintenance cost. In addition, the static routing with the shortest-path fashion at the network gateways is not enough to provide a high quality of service for video/audio data transferring due to the affectation of background traffic. Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that allows a network operator to manage their network environment by programmable centralized control. This not only reduces the cost of maintenance but also increase the performance of networking. In this paper, we proposed an SDN framework for video conference in inter-domain network. The framework used the Packet Pair technique to consider the characteristics of bandwidth and end-to-end delay between two video conference clients. A transferring path and network gateway inside-domain are set up based on this information without a requirement of a routing modification of outside-domains. The evaluation results from Mininet emulator and OF@TEIN testbed show that our framework outperforms the traditional networking significantly in terms of QoS metrics.",

The undoped AlSb films were found to have a cubic crystal structure with (111) preferred orientation and a lattice constant of 5.9985 \u00c5 under compressive strain. For the doped AlSb samples with optimized doping contents, the AlSb:Si and AlSb:Cu films with higher compressive strain were found to have a smaller lattice constant of 5.9588 \u00c5 and 5.9667 \u00c5 respectively. Raman spectroscopy indicated strain states and lower crystalline quality induced by doping. The optical properties, analyzed by UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry, showed that the undoped AlSb film was transparent to IR at around 850 nm, where the doped films were transparent to IR at longer wavelengths. To evaluate the electrical properties of the AlSb films, n-type AlSb:Cu and p-type AlSb:Si films were characterized by Hall-Effect measurements. To develop AlSb-based optoelectronic devices, a PIN diode structure was grown on Si substrate.

The 13C NMR spectra revealed that the synthesized HBE mainly had a dendritic structure as confirmed by the high degree of branching (DB). The addition of PEG in the resin enhanced degree of branching (DB) (from 0.82 to 0.90), epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) (from 697 g eq-1 to 468 g eq-1) as well as curing reaction. Adding 5-10 wt.% PEG in the resin decreased the onset and peak curing temperatures and glass transition temperature; however, adding 15 wt.% PEG in the resin have increased these thermal properties due to the lowest EEW. The curing kinetics were evaluated by fitting the experimental data of the curing behavior of all resins with the \u0160est\u00e1k-Berggren equation. The activation energy increased with the increase of PEG in the resins due to HBE's steric hindrance, whereas the activation energy of HBE15P decreased due to a large amount of equivalent active epoxy group per mass sample.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Nowadays, Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSWF) is considered as one of the most effective techniques to enhance oil recovery. Essential mechanism is a Multi-Ion Exchange (MIE). In carbonate formation, collaboration of Potential Determining Ions (PDI) with rock surface and crude oil results in adjustment of surface equilibrium. These ions in injected brine are thoroughly investigated but effects from formation brine are not well documented. In this study, ratio of divalent ions including calcium and magnesium ions in formation brine is studied. Results from imbibition test shows that formation brine containing calcium ion to magnesium ion ratio of 1:1 yields response to LSWF. Oppositely, formation brines with high ratios of 10:1 and 15:1 do not respond to LSWF. As calcium ion in connate water diffuses to injected water, high calcium ion will exhibit dissolution mechanism of rock surface which is part of oil recovery mechanisms. Formation brine with high calcium ion is therefore not recommended for LSWF. High portion of magnesium ion in formation brine does not affect effectiveness of LSWF. Dissolution of magnesium from rock may be obstructed but oil can still be liberated from calcium carboxylate complex and dissolution of calcium. Coreflood test shows similar result which confirms previous explanation.",

In this paper, we focused on the formal model which is written in Promela language that supports the non-determinism of the concurrent system. From our study, we found that the Promela syntax could probably be drawn by using NS-chart visual symbols. The classic NS-chart symbols represents the control flow of the system that was written in Promela. As a main purpose of this paper, we aim to propose a set of mapping rules for generating the NS-chart drawing from Promela source codes. The result of the drawing with the proposed NS-Chart syntax showed that the Promela control flow structure could be represented succinctly and the chart could be practically used for tracing the counterexample of the verification.",

These models aim to maximize overall part makers' satisfaction. The evaluators are chosen from purchasing management team from 10 part makers. These assessors will evaluate 8 raw material suppliers. This research is divided into 2 parts. The first part is the evaluation of raw material suppliers using Analytic Hierarchy Process. This part weights the importance of decision criteria complying with part makers' satisfaction. The second part proposes a decision model for supplier selection using integer programming. The weight of each criterion from the first part will be considered along with raw material consumption to select the suitable raw material suppliers that maximize overall part makers' satisfaction. The results from the first part of this study show that the most important criterion is cost which is about 41%. Quality, Delivery, Service, and Risk factors are 24%, 14%, 12% and 9%, respectively. The second part shows that the model can match material suppliers to part makers according to their preference. Comparing with current situation, the satisfaction is increased by 26% with this proposed model.

Ten patient-specific VMAT QA were randomly selected to test their error detection sensitivities. Artificial complex errors were introduced to the original plans then the QA tests were repeated. These errors were simulated into three possible scenarios: Uncertainty, miss-calibration, and worst-case scenario. For uncertainty scenario, the random errors (\u03c3) of multi-leaf collimators (MLC) at \u00b1 2.0 mm and gantry angle at \u00b1 2.0 degree were introduced. The systematic errors of +2MU, and the random errors of MLC and gantry angle at \u00b1 2.0 mm and \u00b1 2.0 degree were applied as a miss-calibration scenario. For worst case scenario, errors were integrated between systematic and random variation of MLC and gantry angle at 2\u00b10.5 mm and 2\u00b10.5 degree, respectively. The dosimetric agreements between QA tests on original versus artificial error plans were determined to investigate error detection sensitivity used gamma analysis with 3%, 3 mm criteria.

Unless the condition is near the critical point, it is conventional to assume that the reaction between alumina and water does not take place within short period of time. This assumption also includes amorphous alumina, which is formed via sputtering to protect microelectronic components. This work shows that amorphous alumina film indeed reacts with deionized (DI) water within minutes even in mild conditions. The reaction results in defects on the surface of the alumina, which ultimately progresses into the film, causing a dense film to become porous, as though it had become corroded. Severe surface defects are formed within 60 min of immersion in deionized water at 50 \u00b0C. Characterizations of the corroded film and the study of the effects of various parameters on defect formation indicate that the defects are associated with the hydrolysis of the amorphous alumina.",

The main sources of CO2 is from power plants in the form of flue gas. Recently, the effective technology to capture CO2 is chemical absorption by using aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solution is monoethanolamine (MEA). It has disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. 2-methylaminoethanol (2-MAE) as a new solvent has been formulated to improve the performance of CO2 mitigation but the cost of this chemical is higher. The two amines are mixed together to obtain higher performance and to compensate the drawbacks of each solvents. The objective of this research is to measure the solubility of CO2 in a mixed solvent with 20: 10 wt% of MEA and 2-MAE for CO2 capture from the flue gas stream at the temperature of 313.15 K and 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The experimental results are compared with that of single solution of MEA and 2-MAE at the same conditions. From the results, it is reported that in term of cyclic capacity, the amine mixture provides a better performance, which is higher than that of MEA ranging from 2.35 % to 61.90 % but lower than that of 2-MAE from 8.76 % to 43.45 %. The rate of CO2 loading of mixed solution is relatively close to that of MEA but lower than that of 2-MAE. Therefore, in the future, the mixed solvent may be used as an alternative solution for CO2 capture instead of using single amine.",

Herein, we developed a hybrid electrolyte with graphene oxide as an additive with the functions of promoting the uniform distribution of the electric field and reducing the nucleation overpotential of Zn2+, displaying a smooth zinc electrodeposition layer and reaction kinetics. The resultant zinc symmetric battery with graphene oxide additive affords a stable zinc anode which provided service for more than 650 h at 1 mA cm-2 and an exceptional cycle life of 140 h even at 10 mA cm-2. In addition, scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the deposition of zinc dendrites through the glass fiber separator was the reason for the battery short circuit. It is believed that the graphene oxide additive can remarkably improve the Coulombic efficiency (99.16%) of the batteries via stabilizing the Zn plating/stripping behavior and facilitating Zn2+ nucleation. Consequently, the full battery with graphene oxide electrolyte additive exhibited remarkable enhancements in rate performance and cyclability compared to the additive-free electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte containing solid particles opens a chapter for designing advanced and durable zinc-ion batteries.",

The technique is established in a broad framework allowing a medium made of generally anisotropic materials and cracks of arbitrary shape and under general loading conditions to be treated. A pair of weakly singular, weak-form, displacement and traction boundary integral equations is utilized to formulate the key equations governing the unknown crack-face fields. Besides the basic benefits such as the reduction of spatial dimensions of the solution space and the efficient treatment of unbounded domains and remote boundary data, use of such integral equations in the formulation offers additional positive features including the computational simplicity resulting from the weakly singular nature of all involved integrals and the involvement of a complete set of crack-face displacement fields. A weakly singular symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the special near-front approximation is utilized to solve for the unknown relative crack-face displacement whereas the sum of the crack-face displacement is obtained from the displacement boundary integral equation for cracks via the Galerkin technique. The latter step is one of the essential aspects of the present study that provides the direct means for determining the T-stress data in terms of the sum of the crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack-front. An extensive numerical study is conducted for various scenarios and a selected set of results is reported to demonstrate both the accuracy and capability of the proposed technique.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Waxy crude oils are normally found in petroleum reservoirs. Crude oil from wax formation is one of the crucial problems for flow assurance of pipeline transportation in oil and gas production. This issue can commonly cause wax deposition problem and it has made huge amount of economic loses such as production, time and maintenance cost. Therefore, it is a critical aspect to deal with wax deposition for crude oil flow assurance, especially in cold climate surface region. Nowadays, there are many methods that have been applied to reduce the wax deposition. In general, three methods are commonly utilized, mechanical, thermal and chemical ones. Among them, the usage of chemicals is commonly used in field because they can be applied easily rather than other techniques. In this study, n-heptane is select to study the prevention the wax deposition because its property can reduce the pour point and wax deposit of crude oil. It is easily available as well. Therefore, the aim of this research is investigate the effects of temperature and different chemical concentration on pour point and wax deposition of crude oil at three different temperature ranging from 35 to 55 \u00b0C by applying cold finger method. Also, the pour point of crude oil is measured with different n-heptane concentrations by ASTM method. Moreover, the effect of different chemical concentrations on wax appearance temperature (WAT) is examined the temperature between from 80 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C with three different shear rates by viscometry method. From the results, it is reported that the total wax deposits from the cold finger depend on the amount of chemical concentration used. WAT with 20% n-heptane provides the highest performance for WAT reduction with 41 \u00b0C. Compared to 5%, 10% and 15% n-heptane concentration, WATs are reduced to 45 \u00b0C, 44 \u00b0C and 43 \u00b0C, respectively. For the pour point results, the higher amount of n-heptane concentration offers the higher reduction in pour point temperature and pour points are reduced significantly from original pour point at 36 \u00b0C to 34 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C, 26 \u00b0C and 22 \u00b0C with 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% n-heptane, respectively. It is also found that the amount of total wax deposits decrease when chemical concentrations increase. Moreover, the decline of temperature is found as one of the main factors to cause more wax deposition. There is a highest wax deposit reduction rate with 20% n-heptane at different temperatures compared to other concentration. The wax deposition is reduced over 50% for each concentration. Therefore, this result is useful for the application of wax deposition, pour point and WAT studies in the crude oil production with less damaging environment for sustainable energy production.",

The approach applies a modified concept of elastic compensation algorithm developed within the computationally advantageous ES-FE modelling framework and recovery stress field enhancement. It solely performs a series of standard elastic analyses to successively converge the limit load of structures at plastic collapse. Each analysis systematically adjusts the values of elastic moduli associated with some critical elements as determined by the intensity of stress resultants and hence considers inelastic stress distributions. The computing efforts are as modest as would be required to furnish standard linear elastic analysis procedures. What is important is that the proposed modulus smoothing technique enables the fast assembly of modified stiffness formulations, and the recovery stress field ensures the smoothed C0-continuous admissible stress conditions enhancing the satisfaction of yield conformity over an entire element. Various successfully solved numerical examples highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis framework in overcoming the numerical challenges associated with stress singularity and volumetric locking phenomena under incompressibility conditions. They also address the determination of a lower-bound limit for sufficiently fine ES-FE models.",

The results showed that the vanadium-modified hydrotalcite (V/Mg-Al) exhibited the highest ethanol conversion (34.3%) and acetaldehyde yield (15.5%) at 400\u2103 in the non-oxidative atmosphere. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol, the V/Mg-Al catalyst showed the highest activity at 400\u2103 giving the ethanol conversion and acetaldehyde yield of 73.7% and 29.5%, respectively. This result probably related to the highest base density of V/Mg-Al catalyst (6.13 \u00b5mol CO2/m2) measured by CO2-TPD. The catalytic activity of Mg-Al catalyst and metal modified catalyst slightly decreased upon time-on-stream test for 10 h on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol due to carbon deposition.",

Design criteria are comprised of a quadratic cost function and bounded magnitudes of control inputs. Specifically, we formulate a control synthesis of closed-loop systems operated in a given bounded domain characterized by a semi-algebraic set. We consider an extended class of rational Lyapunov functions and derive an upper bound of the cost function, together with a state-feedback control law. By exploiting bounds on the control input magnitudes, the controller design condition can be cast as a parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality (PDLMI), which is convex optimization and can be efficiently solved by sum-of-squares (SOS) technique. In addition, we derive a sufficient condition to compute a lower bound of the cost function. When choosing polynomial structure of the solution candidate, the lower bound can also be written as PDLMI. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.",

Mostly, FGD gypsum is applied in cement and wallboard industry. Also, it can be used in agricultural activities for soil amendment but the amount of FGD waste used in this function is still low. Furthermore, biochar has long been used to improve soil fertility. The positive impacts of biochar amendment on soils are that it can increase soil capacity to adsorb plant nutrients, decrease soil bulk density, increase plant available water retention and so on. In Thailand, some areas like Nan province has a problem of soil degradation from deforestation and excess use of chemical fertilizer. With the benefits of these FGD waste and biochar, the study of soil amendment will be performed by using degraded soil. Therefore, this research is aimed to apply FGD waste coupled with biochar to improve soil quality from degraded soil in Nan Province. Also, the objective of this work is to evaluate the effects of FGD waste and biochar on soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density and soil texture. The concentrations of FGD waste and biochar are ranged from 5-25% and 5-30% by weight, respectively. The results present that the soil quality has been improved in that pH can increases from 5.664 up to 7.309. The soil texture has changed in the better quality from clay to silty loam or loam. Furthermore, the bulk density of soil is reduced in order to have more space for air and water for all mixture which is conducive to plant growth. Consequently, this research can contribute to the improvement of degraded soil properties to fit well for agriculture and the results can be applied for practice in the real field.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.Food service provided in hospitals has considerable significance, as it is part of the medical treatment. In a sample hospital, food delivery error occupied 37.4% which was the highest complaint among all problems in 2017. This problem has never been investigated for its root causes and there has been no measures established against it. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate for the causes of the discrepancies in the food service provided for the inpatients. Root causes of the inpatient food delivery error are identified by triangulation of quantitative data by survey & complaint analysis and qualitative data by focus group. The first set consists of questionnaire responded by nutrition unit staff, experts in food service and hospital directors, in total of 71 respondents. The questionnaire was modelled after the four types of medication errors[1], [2]. The second set was the review of the food service error from inpatient complaint files recorded during January-December 2017. The third set was focus group interview among 71 hospital staff. The service blueprint was used in search of the pain points. The three methods showed consensus results. Both survey and complaint results revealed that the error were caused by 1)transcribing (61.3%, 54.3%) 2) administration error (25.8%,32.6%) 3) dispensing error (10.1%, 10.9%) 4) prescription error(2.7%, 2.2%). Furthermore, the survey of the relation between themeans of importance and the actual performance in each processrevealed that transcribing error and administration error were theroot causes at 95% confidence level. In addition, focus groupinterview with the 71 hospital staff confirms the finding.Transcribing error included miscommunication and datatransference across the departments. Administration error arisesduring the delivery process. Dispensing error occurred in the foodpreparation and food trays, for example, wrong delivery. Lastly,prescription error was caused by the doctors who were in charge ofordering the patient's dietary requirements. Next, the authorsconducted in-depth case study analysis by using service blueprintwith 217 food delivery case studies. We found that the root causewas the operation of data transference across the departments.Results from this paper urge the need for process innovation in assuring quality of patient food delivery.",

Furthermore, all samples exhibited approximately 99% of shape fixity with recovery time ranging from 8 to 27 min. Interestingly, the incorporation of silicon carbide whisker could significantly increase recovery stress from 3.4 MPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 11.2 MPa (at 20 wt%). Moreover, the addition of silicon carbide whisker provides microwave actuating ability to the sample.

The most recent DCED approach for object segmentation, namely SegNet, is used as one of the benchmarks in evaluating our method.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDH) and their differently calcined derivative catalysts was investigated in this study. The Mg-Al catalysts were synthesized via co-precipitation method and calcined at different temperatures at 450\u2103, 600\u2103 and 900\u2103. It revealed that the calcination temperature affected the physicochemical properties and the catalytic activity of these catalysts toward the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol. It was found that ethanol conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature from 200 to 400\u2103, whereas acetaldehyde selectivity decreased. At low reaction temperature (200-300\u2103), the non-calcined catalyst (Mg-Al-000) showed the highest ethanol conversion, which can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups on surface having acetaldehyde as a major product. The calcination process led to formation of mixed oxide phase in Mg-Al catalysts as proven by the XRD and FT-IR results. The catalyst calcined at 450\u2103 (Mg-Al-450) exhibited the highest basicity as measured by the CO 2 -TPD with ethanol conversion of 45.8% and acetaldehyde yield of 29.7% at 350\u2103.",

Compressive strength of mortar drops with addition of RHA, from a value of 42 MPa of no RHA addition, to 24 MPa of 15wt% RHA addition. Reduction in compression strength may be due to the decrease in density, which arises from porous RHA. This is more dominant in mortar made from addition of RHA without prior acid treated. Carbon residue and impurity in RHA further reduce the compressive strength of mortar.

The average Avrami index n of neat PLA and its composites lay within the same range of 3.0\u20133.6, which reflected the three-dimensional spherulitic growth of PLA with the mixture of instantaneous nuclei and sporadic nuclei. In comparison with the composite cast films, the thermoformed films had higher degree of crystallinity as well as higher tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus owing to the chain orientation upon annealing. Furthermore, the addition of silane-treated talc, especially APTES-treated talc, fastened cold crystallization rate and enhanced tensile properties because of the improved interfacial interaction between talc particles and PLA matrix.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 IEEE.Content less than two hundred words like comments or review statements is known as a short text. Short text classification is useful for automatically categorizing sentence into predefined group. There are several traditional short text classification methods by using bag-of-words with k nearest neighbors (k-NN), Na\u00efve Bayes, Maximum entropy, support vector machines (SVMs), and an algorithm based on statistics and rules. The deep learning method is outperformed other methods on classification of short text with normal size of dataset. Some researches classify requirements into functional and nonfunctional requirements. There is no research on multi-classification of functional requirements with a small dataset particularly for an accounting field. This paper presents an approach to classify short text for a small dataset into multiple categories of functional requirements on the accounting domain. The proposed approach uses an ontology to construct bag-of-words and uses Naive Bayes to classify for small dataset. The experiment is conducted using four hundred of datasets with 5folds and 10-folds cross-validation. The result shows that the method can correctly classify more than 80%. Additionally, comparisons between the ontology-based Naive Bayes method and other methods are investigated.",

Even though a number of formulas based on the limit equilibrium or semi-empirical methods are proposed to predict the uplift capacity of piles in sands, there is a major limitation of the methods in obtaining the accurate predictions. In this paper, the computational limit analysis is employed to investigate the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands. The effects of the important variables including pile length and diameter, soil friction angle and unit weight, and roughness factor at soil-pile interface are examined extensively using the dimensionless parameters while the predicted failure mechanisms associated with the parameters are discussed and compared. Approximate statistical design equations of the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands are developed based on the numerically derived solutions and the existing experimental data. It is found that the proposed design equations provide the most accurate prediction of the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands as compared to the existing formulas.",

The effects of doses in a range of 0\u2013250 kGy on swelling ratio, crosslink density, and thermal stability of UFRs were investigated. Smaller particle size of UFRs was obtained at higher dose. A decrease in the swelling ratio and an increase in crosslink density were well corresponded to crosslinking effect related with absorbed dose. The increase in dose was also found to improve thermal performance of URFs. The influence of irradiated UFRs on impact resistance and glass transition temperature (Tg) of polybenzoxazine composites was also evaluated. The highest impact resistance of the composites belonged to the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 200 kGy. While the significantly enhanced Tg of the composite was obtained by an addition of irradiated UFRs with higher doses, i.e. Tg = 173 \u00b0C for the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 250 kGy. As a consequence, the UFRs can be used to effectively modify thermal and mechanical properties, especially impact resistance of polybenzoxazine composites.",

In this process, the high hydrogen content compound, ethanol, was reacted with steam and oxygen carriers (OCs) through the redox reaction cycle to produce the clean fuel H2. The effects of the different promoters, CeO2 and La2O3, in Al2O3-supported Ni-based OCs were investigated. The mixed promoters Ni-Al2O3 OCs were synthesized by wet impregnation method. The fresh OCs were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and Scanning electron microscope/Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) technique. The redox activity test was performed in a fixed bed reactor by alternating between fuel and air feeds at isothermal condition of 500\u00b0C. The fuel feed was composed of ethanol and steam with steam to ethanol (S/E) mole ratio of 3. It was found that addition of CeO2 and La2O3 on Ni/Al2O3 improved the metal dispersion, reduced the crystallite size and enhanced reducibility of NiO. The La2O3 promoted (Ni/La2O3-Al2O3) and CeO2 and La2O3 co-promoted (Ni/La2O3-CeO2-Al2O3) OCs showed high performance and stability in chemical looping steam reforming of ethanol with the maximum ethanol conversion of 98.3 and 92.5 %, respectively, with maximum H2 yield of 2.9 and 3.2 mol/mol ethanol, respectively. In addition, forming of La2O3-CeO2 solid solution phase in Ni/La2O3-CeO2-Al2O3 oxygen carriers enhanced the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and high oxygen mobility (OM) of OCs, resulting in a lower carbon deposition.",

In the current model, the substrate is treated as an elastic half plane as opposed to a rigid base, and this enables its applications in practical cases when the modulus of the layer (e.g., the coating material) and substrate (e.g., the coated surface) are comparable. The material microstructure is modeled using the generalized continuum theory of couple stress elasticity. The boundary value problems are formulated in terms of the displacement field and solved in an analytical manner via the Fourier transform and stiffness matrix method. The results demonstrate the capability of the present continuum theory to efficiently model the size-dependency of the response of the material when the external and internal length scales are comparable. Furthermore, the results indicated that the material mismatch and substrate stiffness play a crucial role in the predicted elastic field. Specifically, the study also addresses significant discrepancy of the response for the case of a layer resting on a rigid substrate.",

However, there is a lack of studies examining the relationship between sediment trapping efficiency and electricity generation on a basin-wide scale over time. This study aims to assess the efficiency of hydropower production in terms of reservoir sediment trapping. Modified Brune's method examined the relationship between trapped sediments in reservoirs and hydropower production, considering sediment projections for the near future. We divided the cases of existing and planned reservoirs in the mainstream river and subbasins to assess cumulative sediment trapping. Using the Lancang-Mekong River Basin as a case study, the following main findings were observed. Firstly, the existing reservoirs, under baseline conditions (2018), had the potential to trap approximately 60.9% or 82 Mt/yr of the total sediment load. Secondly, around 69% or 110 Mt/yr of the total sediments could be significantly trapped when considering the existing reservoirs and those planned according to the development plan of riparian countries.

All rights reserved.In this present work, diethyl ether, which is currently served as promising alternative fuel for diesel engines, was produced via catalytic dehydration of ethanol over H3PO4-modified - Al2O3 catalysts. The impact of H3PO4 addition on catalytic performance and characteristics of catalysts was investigated. While catalytic dehydration of ethanol was performed in a fixed-bed microreactor at the temperature ranging from 200 \u00baC to 400 \u00baC under atmospheric pressure, catalyst characterization was conducted by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results showed that although the H3PO4 addition tended to decrease surface area of catalyst resulting in the reduction of ethanol conversion, the Al2O3 containing 5 wt% of phosphorus (5P/Al2O3) was the most suitable catalyst for the catalytic dehydration of ethanol to diethyl ether since it exhibited the highest catalytic ability regarding diethyl ether yield and the quantity of coke formation as well as it had similar long-term stability to conventional Al2O3 catalyst. The NH3-TPD profiles of catalysts revealed that catalysts containing more weak acidity sites were preferred for dehydration of ethanol into diethyl ether and the adequate promotion of H3PO4 would lower the amount of medium surface acidity with increasing catalyst weak surface acidity. Nevertheless, when the excessive amount of H3PO4 was introduced, it caused the destruction of catalysts structure, which resulted in the catalyst incapability due to the decrease in active surface area and pore enlargement.",

The H2S removal capability was ranged in the order: V2O5/Y-TiO2 > V2O5/Zr-TiO2 V2O5/TiO2 > V2O5/La-TiO2 > V2O5/Nb-TiO2, which corresponded well to the chemically adsorbed oxygen on oxygen vacancies at catalyst surface (or surface oxygen) as revealed by XPS results. The Y addition could promote the oxygen vacancies formation because of the Ti4+ substitution by less valence Y3+ cations, leading to the improvement of H2S conversion. Whereas the modification by dopants, which have the extra valence cations or larger ionic radius (i.e., Nb or La) suppressed the oxygen vacancies formation, thus leading to lower activity. Despite the stronger interaction between V and Zr-TiO2, the amount of surface oxygen and H2S conversion of the V2O5/Zr-TiO2 were less than the V2O5/Y-TiO2, suggesting that although the formation of oxygen vacancies depended on the interaction between V and M-TiO2, the effect of Ti4+ substitution by transition metal dopant was more pronounced than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. The H2S removal capability corresponded well to the oxygen vacancies being formed more than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. From this study, the V2O5/Y-TiO2 showed the highest H2S conversion at \u223c77% with low SO2 formation (less than 10 ppm).",

All rights reserved.Recently, rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZBs) have attracted extensive interest due to their safety, abundance, low cost, and low toxicity. However, aqueous electrolytes require a polymeric binder to prevent dissolution of the active material in addition to its binding properties. This study highlights binder-free, centimeter long, single-crystal, V2O5 nanofibers (BCS-VONF) on carbon cloth, as the cathode material for AZBs synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal process. BCS-VONF in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2 exhibit promising electrochemical performance with excellent capacity retention. Even in the absence of a binder, BCS-VONF were found to be very stable in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2. They will not yield to the dissolution and detachment of the active material on the current collector. The novel strategy described in this study is an essential step for the development of BCS-VONF on carbon cloth, as a promising cathode material for AZBs.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 Elsevier LtdAmong various analysis methods, response spectrum analysis (RSA) is widely used to compute design forces of structures subjected to earthquake loading. Previous studies indicate that using a single response modification factor (R) to reduce elastic forces contributed from all modes in the RSA procedure is the primary cause for underestimating the design force demands on structures. In this paper, two modified response spectrum analysis (MRSA) methods, MRSAHE based on a higher-mode elastic approach and MRSAHI based on a higher-mode inelastic approach are proposed for computing design shear forces in tall reinforced concrete (RC) shear wall buildings. Here 15-, 20-, 31-, and 39-story tall buildings subjected to earthquake excitations in Bangkok are first designed using the RSA procedure, and then nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA) is carried out. It is found that the RSA procedure provides good estimates for floor displacements and story drift ratios, but significantly underestimates force demands, when compared with NLRHA. The MRSAHE method provides good estimates of shear force for the 15- and 20-story buildings and conservative estimates for the 31- and 39-story buildings; while the MRSAHI method provides good estimates for all cases. However, MRSAHI requires a nonlinear inelastic structural model but MRSAHE does not. In both MRSA methods, the bending moment demands are computed in the same way as the conventional RSA procedure, with ductile detailing in RC walls or columns required at locations where the combined axial and bending strain exceeds a certain limit. In order to determine the locations that require ductile detailing in RC walls or columns, a novel method based on the equal displacement concept using strain from elastic analysis to predict inelastic strain is found to provide good agreement with inelastic strain computed from NLRHA.",

Impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) and co-continuous composites, due to an interconnection on the macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This novel composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results showed that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of the Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxy resin, yield stiffer IPCs than either of the two individual materials alone. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to the brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam.",

The aluminum extrusion is an open source, light weight, and coming with extensive accessory. This significantly reduces cost and gives flexibility to their projects. Its performance is reasonable and adequate for operations among hobbyist and university's projects. However, the precise accuracy of this kind of robot is usually unavailable.

The effect of chromium (Cr) content on heat treatment behavior of multi-alloyed white cast iron with basic alloy composition of 5 mass% Mo, W and V each and 2 mass%C was investigated. Cast iron with varying Cr content from 3 to 9% was prepared. Specimens were annealed at 1223 K and then hardened using fan air cooling from 1323 and 1373 K austenitizing. Hardened specimens were tempered between 673 and 873 K with 50 K intervals. In the as-cast state, the microstructure of specimens with Cr content less than 5 mass% consisted of primary austenite and eutectic structure of (\u00a3 +MC) along with (\u00a3 +M 2 C). The (\u00a3 +M 7 C 3 ) was observed in specimens with Cr content of more than 5 mass%. In as-hardened state, the hardness increased to the highest value at 5 mass%Cr and subsequently decreased with an increase in the Cr content. The volume fraction of retained austenite (V\u00a3) also behaved in the same way with reference to hardness. In the tempered state, evident secondary hardening was observed in all specimens. Maximum tempered hardness (H Tmax ) was obtained at 773798 K tempering. The V\u00a3 values decreased continuously as the tempering temperature increased and they were overall less than 5% at H Tmax . The degree of secondary hardening (\u00a6Hs) increased proportionally with a rise of V\u00a3 in as-hardened state. The H Tmax increased first and then decreased as the Cr content increased. The highest values of H Tmax were obtained in 5 mass%Cr specimen regardless of austenitizing temperature.",

Our three experiments were conducted on BEST 2010 I2R, a standard Thai NLP corpus on F1 measurement, with the different percentage of noises having been synthesized. Firstly, for Tokenization, the result shows that Synthai, a jointed bidirectional LSTM, has the best performance. Additionally, for POS, bi-directional LSTM with CRF has obtained the best performance. For NER, variational bi-directional LSTM with CRF has outperformed other methods. Finally, the effect of noises reduces the performance of all algorithms on these foundation tasks and the result shows that our OOV handling technique could improve the performance on noisy data.",

Coating corrosion behavior was observed in a 3.5% NaCl solution at 25 \u00b0C using Potentiodynamic Polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). EIS circuit models for corrosion kinetics were proposed and the surface area and porosity of the coatings were recorded. Corrosion resistance was found to be higher for the coatings grown at 190 \u00b0C. This could be attributed to high density as well as low porosity. The EIS circuit model suggests the penetration of corrosive electrolytes into pores reaching the steel substrate for the coatings grown at RT. Finite length diffusion inside pores was also observed. The slow infiltration of corrosive electrolytes into the steel substrate could be seen in coatings grown at 130 \u00b0C with diffusion inside the pore similar to that in the coatings grown at RT.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.For many decades, Just-In-Time manufacturing and lean manufacturing have adopted kanban system as a mean to control inventory and production. A number of tagged kanban cards represents inventory of the system, whereas untagged kanban cards equate to production orders. The ideal conditions are a consistent product mixed with a small production lot size and minimum setup time. Such conditions are difficult to obtain even in many automotive assembly lines similar to a case study. The case study assembly line is a glove box assembly production line that assembles two plastic parts and wields them together with a vibration machine after positioning in a mold designed for different products. Because of storage equipment, each kanban card represents 60 identical glove boxes. Therefore, a production engineer re-schedules the production planning to minimize the numbers of changeover without any effect on downstream. This ad hoc production scheduling leads to urgent production orders and interruption of lot size. As a result, the factory embeds historical data into a computer simulation that accounts for current molds, receiving time, and numbers of pending kanban cards, as well as number of storage equipment. The results of this simulation reveals that scheduling criteria and suggest a suitable lot size if the factory decides to change a storage equipment.",

        "Title": "Comparison of EEG measurement of upper limb movement in motor imagery training system",
        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).Background: One of the most promising applications for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface is for stroke rehabilitation. Implemented as a standalone motor imagery (MI) training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system, many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze, wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks, because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Methods: Three hand and wrist movement tasks which were hand opening/closing, wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination were chosen as motor imagery tasks for both hands. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment. All of them completed hand opening/closing task session. Ten subjects completed two MI task sessions which were hand opening/closing and wrist flexion/extension. Five subjects completed all three MI tasks sessions. Each MI task comprised 8 sessions spanning a 4weeks period. For classification, feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used. Two types were implemented, one with conventional CSP (termed WB) and one with an increase number of features achieved by filtering EEG data into five bands (termed FB). Classification was done by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: Eight-fold cross validation was applied on EEG data. LDA and SVM gave comparable classification accuracy. FB achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to WB. The accuracy of classifying wrist flexion/extension task were higher than that of classifying hand opening/closing task in all subjects. Classifying forearm pronation/supination task achieved higher accuracy than classifying hand opening/closing task in most subjects but achieved lower accuracy than classifying wrist flexion/extension task in all subjects. Significant improvements of classification accuracy were found in nine subjects when considering individual sessions of experiments of all MI tasks. The results of classifying hand opening/closing task and wrist flexion/extension task were comparable to the results of classifying hand opening/closing task and forearm pronation/supination task. Classification accuracy of wrist flexion/extension task and forearm pronation/supination task was lower than those of hand movement tasks and wrist movement tasks. Conclusion: High classification accuracy of the three MI tasks support the possibility of using EEG-based stroke rehabilitation system with these movements. Either LDA or SVM can equally be chosen as a classifier since the difference of their accuracies is not statistically significant. Significantly higher classification accuracy made FB more suitable for classifying MI task compared to WB. More training sessions could potentially lead to better accuracy as evident in most subjects in this experiment.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.The effect of hydrogen introduction on Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid was investigated over the WOx catalysts supported on different supports (HY-15, HY-500, MCM-22, SiO2, and Al2O3). The Lewis acid transformation on the catalysts was investigated by in situ diffuse re\ufb02ectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed NH3 at 100 \u00b0C under atmospheric pressure for 130 min. According to the results of in situ DRIFTS, ammonia migration from Lewis acid sites to Bronsted acid sites occurred over the WOx catalysts supported on all different supports. It is proposed that the partial reduction of WOx occurred under the hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The generated oxygen vacancies of the supported WOx catalysts were found to play an important role for activating the hydrogen spillover, leading to Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid. It was suggested that the selected support is the crucial factor for Lewis acid transformation performances. The results from our experiments showed that the weak interaction between WOx and support led to the easy reduction of W species, which promoted the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The large amount of oxygen vacancies leads to high Lewis acid transformation. Moreover, the influence of different supports was discussed and investigated by several analytical techniques such as H2-TPD, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, UV\u2013vis, XRD, XPS, and TEM-EDS techniques.",

A few hours of downtime often occurred in a day which directly impacted on the production and in turn led to the late weekly shipment. On average, in 2018, only 83% of the shipments were on time (the target is 95%). One of the main root cause was the lack of materials due to unorganized inventory management that caused longer time to find materials. In order to reduce the downtime and improve the space utilization of the warehouse, inventory management and warehouse management systems were reviewed and a number of solutions were introduced. Firstly, inventories were classified and slow-moving or unused items were removed from the warehouse. Secondly, ABC analysis was introduced for the active ones. The layout of the warehouse was re-designed and a new operations system was developed. The result shows that inactive items had occupied most of the warehouse space equivalent to 1,342 pallets which were put in the disposal list. Moreover, new material handling equipment was brought into the warehouse to facilitate its operations.",

However, there are some patients with permanent impairments, which cannot improve from rehabilitation. Thus, portable assistive devices could greatly help them performing simple activities of daily living (ADL), but such device has not been fully explored, the present design of tendon routing cannot closely replicate finger orientation and motion during grasping. Improving the flexion tendon would increase the possibility of grasping for patients with hand disability. This research aims to develop a tendon routing design of a soft exoskeleton to increase compatibility with human hand, while it can execute tasks and exercises more naturally compared to normal limbs to help stroke patients to live independently.

Two PCMs, methyl palmitate and n-octadecane, with operating temperature appropriated for thermal comfort in trocical countries were selected. The composition of emulsion, i.e. tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and n-octadecane or methyl palmitate, was varied to find the optimal conditions for encapsulation. The influence of composition and process time on PCM's emulsion stability, size and structure of microcapsules, and encapsulation efficiency were investigated. The results showed that the optimal PCM to silica ratio was determined by the maximum quantity that could maintain the rigidity of the microcapsule structure. The low surfactant concentration that could still sustain emulsion stability contributed to improved encapsulation efficiency.",

When changes occur, it may impact functional requirements and thus the changes should be controlled. Each function appeared in functional requirement consists of function name, description of function, inputs and outputs specification, and error messages of the function. Inputs and outputs specification of each function can be specified in terms of input and output names, input and output data types, as well as input and output constraints. Inputs and outputs of each function may be related and not related to database schema. Thus, when changes of inputs or outputs of a function that are related to database schema are occurred, the database schema and test cases of the function will be affected.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 IEEE.The item cold-start problem occurs when a recommendation system cannot recommend new items owing to record deficiencies and new listing omissions. When searching for real estate, users can register a concurrent interest in recent and prior projects. Thus, an approach to recommend cold-start and warm-start items simultaneously must be determined. Furthermore, unrequired membership and stop-by behavior cause real estate recommendations to have many cold-start and new users. This characteristic encourages the use of a content-based approach and a session-based recommendation system. Herein, we propose a real estate recommendation approach for solving the item cold-start problem with acceptable warm-start item recommendations in the many-cold-start-users scenario. We modify a session-based recommendation system and employ existing mechanisms to efficiently deal with sequential and context information for the next-interacted item's encoded attribute prediction. Subsequently, we use the nearest-neighbors approach using weighted cosine similarity to determine conforming candidates. We use Recall@K and MRR@K with the top-n recommendation to evaluate warm-start and cold-start item recommendations among different applied mechanisms and against the baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of efficiently integrating the information and the difficulty in performing well in warm-start and cold-start item recommendations simultaneously. Our proposed approach illustrates the capability of solving the item cold-start problem while yielding promising results in both recommendations although neither result is the best. We believe that our approach provides a suitable compromise between both recommendations and that it will benefit recommendation tasks focusing on both recommendations.",

The physical and chemical properties of ZSM-5 were described by XRD, SEM-EDX, N2 physicsorption, FT-IR, pyridine-IR, 1H MAS NMR, TPO, and NH3-TPD techniques. For the characterization, the Na-ZSM-5 consisted of two main types of acid sites (weak and medium acid sites), whereas strong, medium, and weak acid sites were detected on H-ZSM-5. For H-ZSM-5, the Si-(OH)-Al site (strong Br\u00f8nsted site) was an active site for 1-butene cracking reaction, while the active site of Na-ZSM-5 in the reaction was silanol nest (moderate Br\u00f8nsted site). The 1-butene cracking reaction on H-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-5 was studied under the operating condition of temperature =500 \u00b0C, pressure =1 atm, and WHSV =3 h\u22121. The oligomerization, cracking, and hydrogen transfer were three main reactions in the 1-butene cracking mechanism. The alkenes excluding propylene occurred on weak acid site, while the formation of propylene underwent on medium acid site of ZSM-5 catalyst. The presence of strong acid site on ZSM-5 catalyst promoted the hydrogen transfer reaction, which provoked the alkane formation. The hydrogen transfer index in 1-butene reaction of Na-ZSM-5 was less than H-ZSM-5 in all Si/Al molar ratios because of the absence of strong acid. The Na-ZSM-5 (Si/Al molar ratio = 20) reached the highest propylene selectivity at 31.73 C-wt.% and the Na+ ion could block the strong acid site. At low Si/Al molar ratio, the stability of Na-ZSM-5 was higher than H-ZSM-5 because of the lower coke formation. Therefore, the Na-ZSM-5 was more suitable catalyst than H-ZSM-5 for propylene formation in 1-butene cracking reaction.",

This paper presents two estimation formulations, one each for confirmatory and exploratory SEM, where a zero pattern of the estimated path matrix can explain a causality structure of the variables. The original nonlinear equality constraints of the model parameters were relaxed to an inequality, allowing the transformation of the original problem into a convex framework. A regularized estimation formulation was then proposed for exploratory SEM using an l1-type penalty of the path coefficient matrix. Under a condition on problem parameters, our optimal solution is low rank and provides a useful solution to the original problem. Proximal algorithms were applied to solve our convex programs in a large-scale setting. The performance of this approach was demonstrated in both simulated and real data sets, and in comparison with an existing method.

However, it can be used in many industries like food industries and in petroleum to enhance the oil recovery for oil production. However, the amount of carbon dioxide or supply is not enough because the cost of carbon capture is high. The main sources of carbon dioxide come from power plants and natural gas processing. The technology is carbon capture and storage. Currently, the effective technology to remove carbon dioxide to the lower level is chemical absorption and chemicals used in this technology play an important role. Nowadays, the commercially used solvents are monoethanolamine. Nevertheless, it also has disadvantages such as low capacity, corrosion and high energy requirement for regeneration; thus, making this technology not economically viable. Therefore, many new solvents such as 2-(methylamino)ethanol have been developed to improve efficiency and to compensate the drawbacks of conventional solution for carbon dioxide capture. Consequently, the aim of this work is to measure the solubility data of carbon dioxide in a 5M aqueous solution of 2-(methylamino)ethanol as a solvent at the temperature from 30 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C and partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The solubility results of carbon dioxide in 2-(methylamino)ethanol solution are compared with that of the aqueous solution of monoethanolamine at the same conditions. In term of cyclic capacities, the results show that 2-(methylamino)ethanol provides higher performance which is up to 86.8% and 150.9% higher than that of monoethanolamine at 15 and 100 kPa, respectively. Furthermore, the results present that the loading can increase as partial pressure increases and decrease at higher temperature. This can result in the decrease in energy requirement for solution regeneration and liquid-circulation rate, leading to the reduction in the overall cost of carbon capture.",

The configuration of the microchannel allows the flow pattern to be confined uniformly across the channel width and length, thereby resulting in a uniform deposited thin film covering the whole surface of the substrate. A parametric study of the deposition of CuxS thin films was performed, including the effects of deposition time (2\u201310 min), flow rate (2\u20136 ml/min) and reaction temperature (60\u201380 \u00b0C). It was observed that the basic characteristics of CuxS films, such as morphology, film thickness, film composition and optical band gap, were highly affected by all deposition parameters. We were able to attain smooth, dense and adherent CuxS film with homogeneous grains at a high growth rate of 1.8 \u03bcm/h, by optimizing the controllable parameters. The optimized condition was at temperature of 80 \u00b0C, flow rate of 6 ml/min and deposition time of 4 min. The results showed that the film formation by heterogeneous nucleation and growth on the substrate is promoted over homogeneous reaction in the solution phase, which is strongly due to the incorporation of the optimal channel design in a micro-scale structure together with the controlled deposition parameters. This method can overcome the issue of the deposition in limited area and can be scaled for large-area substrates with good uniformity of CuxS films.",

        "Title": "CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas for enhanced oil recovery",
        "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Due to the climate change and global warming, the concern about CO2 emission into the atmosphere has been raised in many industries such as oil and gas business. The sources of CO2 include natural gas processing and other processes. The current technology to mitigate CO2 is carbon capture, storage and utilisation. At the same time, oil production is expected to increase due to the higher consumption. CO2 geological storage in depleting oilfield coupled with enhanced oil recovery can be a better technology to meet both requirements. The excellent example of this technology is the Weyburn Project in Canada that can store CO2 and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life. From this successful project, the technology is studied by applying it with the depleting oilfield for both oil production and CO2 storage in the North of Thailand by using simulation model. It becomes the objective of this research, which is to evaluate CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas (WAG) for enhanced oil recovery as well as to study the effects the parameters, such as total hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) injection and WAG ratio, on oil production and CO2 consumption and sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, with the added benefit of carbon sequestration. CMG software from Computer Modeling Group Ltd. is used to create the 3D simulation model to predict the CO2 storage in the geological formation. From the simulation, the results reported that oil can be produced up to 125,976 m3 of oil or 57 % recovery, CO2 consumption is 66,261 m3 of gas and CO2 utilisation is approximately 0.53 m3 of gas per m3 of oil. The main parameters for WAG process is WAG ratio in that oil production increases as WAG ratio increases. CO2 consumption increases with total HCPV injection. The results of this study can be applied to develop the CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the depleting oilfield in the North of Thailand for both oil production and CO2 storage.",

E-waste mismanagement caused by illegal transport of WEEE has intensified public health and environmental concerns. Computers are processed in recycling industries, but they still contain vulnerable metal remnants, such as gold. High-grade components, such as Random-Access Module (RAM), for example, are often extracted by hydrometallurgical processes through different leaching chemicals along with their related methods. Gold leaching agents, including aqua regia and cyanide-based solutions, were considered to extract gold from computer RAM in this study. Environmental impacts of the two extracting processes were investigated using material flow analysis and life cycle assessment, based on 1 kg of recovered gold. The effect of pulp density was also measured. The comparison between the two leaching processes without waste management demonstrated that the cyanide-based solution provided 8.5 times lower in terrestrial ecotoxicity and 6.4 times lower in human carcinogenic toxicity than aqua regia due to the lower overall chemical consumption. Nevertheless, proper wastewater treatments and a combination of incineration and landfill for solid waste treatment are potential options to minimize these impacts.",

Energy management system (EMS) is very important for power system planning and operation of microgrid. To make sure that the generation meets challenges of load profile requires more robust and effective EMS of microgrid. Specifically, the planning and operation of power supply needs to incorporate the load forecast for the optimal dispatch strategy. This paper proposes Model Predictive Control (MPC) of EMS to dispatch generation power in microgrid for minimum total operating cost. The load forecast is obtained by recurrent neural network for one day ahead. The efficiency and accuracy of load forecasting model affects the efficiency of dispatch algorithm of microgrid. The proposed algorithm is applied to a case study of Mae Hong Son (MHS) microgrid including battery energy storage system and power exchange with utility grid to satisfy load demand for both actual load and forecasted load profiles. We apply MPC to dispatch energy in normal operation and compare the total operating cost (TOC) with that of the previous EMS. It is found that the proposed MPC can significantly reduce TOC ranging from 25% to 45%.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Plastic waste has been incorporated with asphalt to improve the physical properties of asphalt and alleviate the increasing trend of plastic waste being introduced into the environment. However, plastic waste comes in different types such as thermoplastic or thermoset, which results in varied properties of polymer modified asphalt (PMA). In this work, four thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) were prepared using different peroxide concentrations to produce four formulations of gel content (with varying extent of crosslinked part) in order to imitate the variation of plastic waste. All four TPVs were then mixed with asphalt at 5 wt% thus producing four formulations of PMA, which went through physical, rheological, and storage stability assessments. PMA with higher gel content possessed lower penetration and higher softening temperature, indicating physically harder appearance of PMA. Superpave parameters remained unchanged among different gel content PMA at temperatures of 64, 70, and 76\u25e6 C. PMA with any level of gel content had lower Brookfield viscosity than PMA without gel content at a temperature of 135\u25e6 C. Higher gel content resulted in shorter storage stability measured with greater different softening temperatures between top and bottom layers of PMA after 5 days of 163\u25e6 C storage. This study shows that asphalt with thermoset plastic waste is harder and easier to pave, thus making the non-recycling thermoset plastic waste more useful and friendly to the environment.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2013 IEEE.The BPMN design models are widely used in the software development process. Owing to the lack of BPMN standard semantics, formal verification is used to validate whether the BPMN design model is free of undesirable properties. The primary challenges of BPMN design model verification are the enormous size and complexity of BPMN design models; these challenges may lead to time-consuming processes for model abstraction and overcoming the state space explosion problem. This paper proposes a hierarchical verification technique for the state space analysis based on a colored Petri net (CPN). A BPMN partitioning technique and rules for the transformation of a BPMN into a CPN model are provided. The partitioning approach supports the unstructured BPMN design model, and the obtained CPN model also supports hierarchical verification. To validate and analyze the BPMN design model, the transformation technique and state space generator are implemented as a BPMN verification framework. This method is a viable option for the software process designers and is suitable for the large-scale BPMN design model verification.",

Typically, raw biogas consists of 50\u201370% methane (CH4), 30\u201350% carbon dioxide (CO2), and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water vapour. Purifying biogas by removing CO2 and other trace impurities is required in order to achieve higher calorific value, safe operation and to meet fuel standards. As CO2 is the second largest component of biogas, this study focused on its removal from CH4. RESULTS: Composite membranes of blended PEG 400/Pebax 1657 polymer and graphene oxide (GO) were developed for CO2/CH4 gas separation. The effects of GO loading and PEG 400 addition on CO2/CH4 separation performance were investigated. Optimal loadings of 0.25 wt% GO and 50 wt% PEG 400 obtained the best membrane performance with 12.4 GPU of CO2 permeance and 14 of CO2/CH4 separation factor. CONCLUSION: Incorporating GO to the polymer membrane enhanced CO2/CH4 separation, whereas PEG 400 addition increased CO2 permeance.

In the absence of ND, a compositional ratio of 10/90 (Sn/CNT) demonstrated the highest current density. However, by adding ND in a compositional ratio of 10/90/100 (Sn/CNT/ND) the highest efficiency towards formate/formic acid was achieved. It was observed that the presence of ND enhanced the selectivity of product for formic acid. The effects of bicarbonate concentration and scan rate have also been studied to understand the reduction mechanism. The peak potential shifted towards larger negative values of applied potential with an increase in the scan rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V/s, confirming the irreversible nature of the reduction process. The linear relationship between the current and the square root of the scan rate (with a slope value of 0.519) suggested that the reaction process is fully diffusion-controlled. Formic acid was produced using both electrodes; however, the electrode containing nano-diamond successfully improved the process yield for formic acid.

Sawdust is suitable to be converted to the gaseous product due to its high proportion of volatile (73%). In this work, sawdust thermal conversion was investigated by using a stairmand type cyclone gasifier with 100 mm diameter. The operation of the cyclone with short residence time and high efficiency of particulate separation from the gaseous product is suitable for a small particle like sawdust. The influences of equivalence ratio (0.15-0.60) and reactor temperature (700\u00b0C , 800\u00b0C and 900\u00b0C ) on the waste conversion performance were determined.

The investigation focused on the effects of fire exposure condition and the presence of internal steel reinforcements on the effective bond length, failure mode, bond strength (maximum joint load) and interfacial fracture energy. After being air-cooled, the concrete prisms were adhesively bonded with CFRP strips of different lengths, and then quasi-static tested at the ambient condition. The pull-off test results showed that the tensile strength of concrete substrate decreased after being exposed to elevated temperatures. Such deterioration of concrete substrate caused an increase in the effective bond length. It also decreased the bond strength and interfacial fracture energy. The steel reinforcements in concrete structures are beneficial as they minimize the effect of fire exposure on bond strength and effective bond length. An application of the fracture mechanics-based model for strength prediction of bond between fire-damaged concrete and the CFRP plate is proposed. A linear relationship between interfacial fracture energy and pull-off tensile strength of concrete could be assumed for the unreinforced concrete.",

However, previous research has developed sensor system for detecting the accident which can only be applied to crane prototype in laboratory. The objective of this research is to develop a sensor warning system (SW system) for warning construction workers from unsafe conditions. This study focuses on a lifting operation of the tower crane. The SW system is developed based on the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, GPS sensor, and server. In this paper, the pilot test was conducted on testing GPS devices which could lead to determine the distance error and calibrate the system. As a result, the average of distance error was 1.96 meters for calibrating the system. Further study will continue to develop the full-scale system which can be applied to construction site.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.This research focuses on the development of a heuristic method for the Toothpaste Filling Problem (TFP) whose complication lies on a vast variety of products (formulae and sizes), together with specific restrictions on filling machines and storage tanks. More specifically, filling machines are non-identical, each of which has different speeds and capacities for filling toothpaste of various sizes. As unloading requires storage tanks, each with much larger capacity when compared to one particular production order, a tank will be then matched with several production orders and be repositioned among filling machines to avoid unnecessary changeovers. We solve the TFP by means of a two-phase method, where the initial solution is constructed by an Earliest Due Date (EDD) dispatching rule. Once completed, the initial solution is then iteratively improved by a series of improvement operators, mimicking the concept of Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS), until no improvement could be found. We test our heuristic on a set of sample instances acquired from one of the biggest consumer products manufacturers in Thailand. Impressively, when compared to the current practice, our proposed heuristic could help reduce makespan by 32% on average, or equivalently an annual saving of $0.6 million, mainly from the reduction on overtime payment and changeovers.",

        "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The study focuses on an improvement of the catalytic activity via CO oxidation for Pt/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst by addition of La onto the support prior to impregnation with Pt metals. The molar ratios of La/Al were varied from 0.01 to 0.15. Based on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, La addition ap-parently resulted in increased basicity of the catalysts, which is related to increasing of oxygen mobili-ty. However, when considered the Pt dispersion measured by CO chemisorption, it was found that Pt dispersion also increased with increasing the amount of La addition up to La/Al = 0.05. It is suggested that too high amount of La addition can inhibit the dispersion Pt due to surface coverage of La. It is worth noting that the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation essentially depends on both Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility and they can be superimposed on each other. Based on this study, the Pt/?-Al2O3 catalyst with La addition of La/Al molar ratio = 0.05 showed the highest activity due to its optimal Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility leading to its highest value of turnover frequency (TOF).",

Experiments were conducted by exposing Ca2+ and CO3 2\u2212 solutions to magnetic fields. The solutions were then combined to form CaCO3 particles. Three characteristics of CaCO3 formation reaction have been investigated, namely absorbance differentiation, vibrational modes and crystal structure. Absorbances were measured using ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrophotometer, while vibrational modes were measured using Flourier transform (FT) infrared and FT Raman spectroscopies. X-ray diffractometer was used to determine the crystal structure. Experimental results show that the nucleation of CaCO3 crystals was inhibited when starting solutions were exposed to magnetic fields. The effect of magnetic fields was mainly attributed to CO3 2\u2212 solution and remained for more than 144 h after starting solutions were combined. As various magnetic field strengths were applied to the solutions, aragonite was formed, and aragonite/calcite ratios were proportional to magnetic field strengths. Using the X-ray technique, the measured crystal structure indicated that the aragonite/calcite ratio increased from 10 to 82% when the magnetic field strength was increased from 60 to 460 mT for the duration of 8 min.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier LtdThe use of recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete provides an eco-friendly alternative for the construction industry. Since geopolymer concretes made with recycled aggregates generally have weaker internal structure compared with those using natural aggregates, SiO2-rich materials have therefore been used to improve the strength properties, one of which is the well-known nano-SiO2 (nS). However, because nS is not environmental friendly, other green SiO2-rich materials, such as rice husk ash (RHA) from agricultural wastes, are needed. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of replacing nano-SiO2 with rich husk ash for improving the performance of recycled aggregate geopolymer concrete (RAGC) made from high-calcium fly ash that is able to set and harden without heat curing. The mechanical properties and fire-resistant performance of RHA-added and nS-added geopolymer concretes were tested and compared. The results show that the addition of RHA is effective in improving the strengths of RAGCs, particularly when the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is increased to 4.17. The 28-day compressive strengths of RAGCs containing RHAs ranged from 36.0 to 38.1 MPa due to the improved microstructure and denser matrix and were comparable to those of RAGCs made with nS. However, the inclusion of SiO2-rich materials had an adverse effect on the post-fire residual strength of geopolymer concretes made from recycled aggregates due primarily to the reduced porosity.",

Recently, the maximum depth of excavation has increased up to approximately \u221225 m. Deep excavation in Bangkok subsoils requires consideration of the soil conditions and the real piezometric level of ground water. In general, Bangkok subsoil consists of 13~16 m of thick, dark grey soft-to-medium clay, followed by stiff, silty clay, before the first sand layer at 21~30 m. The piezometric level of ground water has risen to \u221213 m from its previous level of \u221223 m due to the control of deep well pumping for twenty years by the Thai Government. A diaphragm wall is normally used as a soil retaining structure. The behavior and performance of a diaphragm wall is usually predicted by the finite element method (FEM) using Mohr\u2013Coulomb soil modeling as failure criteria, with the soil modulus parameters for soft and stiff Bangkok clay from the self-boring pressuremeter test. This paper presents a comparison between the diaphragm wall movements from FEM analysis predictions and field measurements for two projects, the new Bank of Thailand head office and the Rosewood Hotel, which were constructed with different techniques.

This paper provides the assessment of the construction of the MTP Port project on the shoreline of the Rayong Bay. Historical shoreline positions were extracted from aerial photography and satellite imagery taken between 1957 and 2016 using ArcGIS version 10.4. The rates of shoreline changes pre- and post-port development were implemented using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Results indicate that the Rayong Bay shoreline mostly was in dynamic equilibrium with an average rate of less than 0.5 m/y prior the construction of the MTP port. After the completion of the port, a significant shoreline accretion has continuously been found along the shoreline of about 500 m adjacent to both sides of the port. Meanwhile, the Rayong Bay shoreline had been eroded about 28 % of the total shoreline after the port completed in 1992 and increased to 30% after the port expansion in 2002. Coastal protection structures included seawalls, segment breakwater, Y-shaped groins, and jetty were applied along the receded shore. Most of those structures have successfully stabilized the shoreline, and the Rayong Bay has likely reached a new dynamic equilibrium since 2011.",

The effects of the reaction temperature and time, amount of dichlorocarbene precursor, and the type and amount of phase transfer agent on the chlorine content were investigated. The highest chlorine content (30%) in DCBR was obtained using 0.062 mol chloroform and 0.003 mol cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at room temperature for 19 hours although 27.9% was obtained after 12 hours. The kinetics of this dichlorocarbene modification was best described by the pseudo\u2013first order rate law with 2 rate constants. For practical applications, the DCBR with chlorine contents of 10%, 20%, or 30% were blended with natural rubber (NR) and then vulcanized using the sulfur-curing system. Although the polarity of DCBR was increased, a good compatibility between NR and DCBR still existed, resulting in improved mechanical properties. The oil resistance, flame retardant, and ozone resistance properties of the NR/DCBR blend vulcanizates were enhanced compared to those of a NR/butadiene rubber blend vulcanizate, which was related to the amount of chlorine incorporated into the DCBR.",

The shear capacity of the beam with the corrosion degree of 17% was higher than that of the uncorroded beam, whereas the shear capacity of the beam with the corrosion degree of 12% was lower than that of the uncorroded beam. The shear efficiency of damaged beams can be recovered by repairing them using SFRC that contains a reasonable amount of steel fibers. In addition, two methods to estimate the shear capacity of the repaired beams are developed using the modified truss analogy and strut-and-tie models.

Reactions were performed at the pressure of 25 barg, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 1.7 h-1, and H2/oil of 630 NL/L over CoMo/Al2O3 as catalyst. The effect of temperature was studied in the range of 275-300 \u00b0C. Both deoxygenation and desulfurization led to approximately 100% conversions at 300 \u00b0C, while at 275 \u00b0C, palmitic acid deoxygenation was recorded at a higher conversion rate compared with that of the desulfurization of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene. The presence of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene during the deoxygenation of palmitic acid resulted in high conversions (>95%). Pressure drop studies showed that the formation of heavy products caused a gradual pressure drop throughout the reactor over time. The catalyst was deactivated during 10 d. Two different sulfur-containing reagents were used for catalyst reactivation including dimethyl-disulfide in n-C18 and LGO containing 484 ppmw of sulfur.

Hence, the objective of this research is to monitor the relation between the surface roughness and the cutting forces in aluminium turning process with a wide range of cutting conditions. The coated carbide tool and aluminium alloy (Al 6063) are used for this experiment. The cutting parameters are investigated to analyze the effects of them on the surface roughness which are the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius and the depth of cut. In the case of this research, the dynamometer is installed in the turret of CNC turning machine to generate a signal while turning. The relation between dynamic cutting forces and the surface roughness profile is examined by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The experimentally obtained results showed that the cutting force depends on the cutting condition. The surface roughness can be improved when increasing the cutting speed and the tool nose radius in contrast to the feed rate and the depth of cut. The relation between the cutting parameters and the surface roughness can be explained by the in-process cutting forces.

Despite no requirement of external forces, it requires strong hydrodynamic forces that could potentially cause cell damage or loss during the separation process. This might lead to the wrong interpretation of laboratory results since the change of structures and functional characteristics of cells due to the hydrodynamic forces that occur are not taken into account. Therefore, it is important to investigate the cell viability and damage along with the separation efficacy of the device in the design process. In this study, two inertial separation techniques-spiral microchannel and contraction-expansion array (CEA)-were examined to evaluate cell viability, morphology and intracellular structures using a trypan blue assay (TB), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Wright-Giemsa stain. We discovered that cell loss was not significantly found in a feeding system, i.e., syringe, needle and tube, but mostly occurred in the inertial separation devices while the change of cell morphology and intracellular structures were found in the feeding system and inertial separation devices. Furthermore, percentage of cell loss was not significant in both devices (7-10%). However, the change of cell morphology was considerably increased (30%) in spiral microchannel (shear stress dominated) rather than in CEA (12%). In contrast, the disruption of intracellular structures was increased (14%) in CEA (extensional and shear stress dominated equally) rather than spiral microchannel (2%). In these experiments, leukocytes of canine were used as samples because their sizes are varied in a range between 7-12 \u03bcm, and they are commonly used as a biomarker in many clinical and medical applications.",

Various time series models are applied for monthly forecast and an algorithm based on seasonal pattern is proposed for daily forecast. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are used for comparing the proposed methodology and the current model that the bank uses.

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Image denoising is a classical challenge in computer vision and has attracted a large amount of research in the past few decades in attempts to find new approaches to denoise various types of images. The endeavors have been even more striking with the recent inception of deep learning. Deep learning has a well-known strength in its accuracy and effectiveness but with the main drawback of very long converging time during deep learning network training. Moreover, current state-of-the-art denoising techniques still lack the edge feature, one of the crucial attributes for sharp images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional neural network with Edge Feature (DCEF) for denoising Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). However, as the deep learning model training takes too much time to converge, we also propose an adaptive learning rate using a triangle technique that allows much faster converging time comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. Our DCEF demonstrates that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of average PSNR scores in = 15 and 25 by 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, while achieving high MS-SSIM scores and using much fewer iterations to converge.",

This study investigates a solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell system integrated with a gas turbine (GT) for power generation. The advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) system is designed to enhance the system flexibility. Simulations of the proposed power system are performed to demonstrate the amount of power that can supply to the loads during normal and peak modes of operation under steady-state conditions. The pressure ratios of the GT and AA-CAES and the additional air feed are used to design the system and analyze the system performance. The results show that a small additional air feed to the GT is certainly required for the hybrid system. The GT pressure ratio of 2 provides a maximum benefit. The AA-CAES pressure ratio of 5 is recommended to spare some air in the storage and minimize storage volume. Moreover, implementation of the GT and AA-CAES into the integrated fuel cell system allows the system to cope with the variations in power demand.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Knee's severe patellofemoral joint degeneration gives a lot of people difficulty to endure daily life because walking or any leg movement can cause serious pain. At present, physical examination, x-ray and MRI are often used to diagnose the condition; however, each of the methods has its own disadvantages. For instance, physical examination is highly dependent on the skill of the doctor who practiced the examination, which cannot avoid misdiagnosing the condition. X-ray can detect wounds and tears, but the accuracy is also not top-notch since the result of an x-ray is a 2-dimension picture. MRI is the most reliable method for diagnosing the condition; however, the cost is very high. We propose that other than x-ray and MRI, patellofemoral joint degeneration can be identified by analyzing vibrational signals obtained from an accelerometer attached to the patella while sitting and moving the leg up and down. At the beginning of the study, swine's knees are used to imitate human's knee. Swine's knees with various surface degradation levels are put on a machine that mimics the mechanism of knee motion. An accelerometer is mounted on the patella of the swine's knee while the machine is running to measure the friction and roughness induced vibration of the patella. The vibration results suggest that more surface degradation the higher vibration signal amplitude. Nevertheless, the method still needs a lot more improvement on the database and testing procedures, in order to make it accurate, dependable and affordable. Hence, with further analysis on patient's knees it is highly possible to determine whether patient's knee is degraded or not and at what degradation level.",

CAS consists of three steps e.g., obstacle sensing, collision prediction, and collision avoidance. Collision prediction enables drones to gain information, process information, and estimate whether the object has a risk of collision. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is one of the methods that can be employed for collision prediction. However, CNN is a method that needs a large data in the training. Dario Pedro et al. provided a dataset called the CoLANet dataset that consists of VDOs of collision drones. Subsequently, they proposed a new algorithm called Neural Network Pipeline which has a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) part to extract the feature from a couple of images. CNN extracts images by using MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained model. They chose MobileNetV2 due to training performance from another dataset. This paper aims to assess the performance of lightweight CNN models using the CoLANet dataset. The models will be trained on the Keras library with parameters of fewer than ten million. The models will be validated by Confusion Matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristics. In conclusion, we examine which pre-trained CNN model has the best performance and suggest ongoing work.",

The catalyst with a Ni to Re molar ratio of 1 : 0.12 exhibited superior performance for diesel production containing large fraction of iso-alkanes in comparison to Ni and Re benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations revealed that the detection of Ni and Re co-existed with NiO and ReOx on SAPO-11 after the reduction confirmed by XRD, XANES, and XPS analysis gave a large distribution of Lewis acid sites (>80 %) noticed by Pyridine-DRIFTS measurement. Under investigations of WHSV, reaction temperature, and H2 pressure, the NiRe0.12 catalyst contributed a nearly theoretical 77.1 % liquid yield, accompanied by a 18.2 % jet-range and 52.1 % diesel-range yields with a classification for 46.8 % iso-alkanes and 23.5 % normal alkanes yields; whereas, the cold-flow properties of liquid product were in the ranges of winter diesel standard.

The results show that both calcium and carbonate precursors affect morphologies of CaCO3; CaCO3,Cl-Urea, and CaCO3,Cl-Na have calcite phase, whereas mixed-phases of calcite (30%) and vaterite (70%) are observed with CaCO3,Ac-Na, and aragonite is found with CaCO3,Ac-Urea.

As a promoter, Ce played a crucial role in improving the structure, properties and catalytic performance of the Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The structure and chemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, in situ XRD, TEM, STEM-EDX mapping, N2O titration, H2-TPR, H2-TPD, XPS, XAES, etc. The characterization results disclosed that the addition of a Ce promoter to the Cu/SiO2 catalysts remarkably increased the Cu dispersion and retarded the sintering of small-sized Cu species. The strong interaction between the Ce promoter and Cu species substantially changed the redox properties of xCe-Cu/SiO2 catalysts and made the Cu2+ species easy to reduce. In addition, the activation ability of H2 species was significantly improved in the xCe-Cu/SiO2 catalysts, as evidenced by H2-TPD studies.

Model parameter estimation was implemented in MATLAB and the response data test was categorized into three sections including single-step, multi-step and random-step responses. With respect to single-step response, both the transfer function and HW model were able to predict the response curve. As expected, the linear model exhibited lower accuracy than the nonlinear model. For multi-step and random-step responses with various step-size, the linear model cannot cope with the experimental behavior and is not able to provide accurate prediction of battery dynamics. One of the first conclusions of the study was that the nonlinear characteristic of the battery cannot be ignored, and the linear model might be inappropriate to predict the dynamic behavior of the battery.

Results indicate that the developed bond model is reasonable for simulating ETS\u2013concrete interfaces, and the method for deriving the shear contribution of ETS FRP bars through bonding-based mechanism shows good performance compared to other shear models. Bonding parameters such as interfacial ductility index (B) and interfacial energy (Gf) are observed to strongly affect the performance of strengthened members. Moreover, finite element (FE) simulations of beams strengthened with ETS bars were conducted, and the proposed bonding approach was utilized. Comparisons between the results achieved from FE modeling and experiments clarify that FE simulation with the proposed bond model is effective for analyzing shear strengthened beams by ETS bars.",

        "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 IEEE.Platooning is a challenging application because it requires a frequent rate of beaconing. Performance of traditional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance method (CSMA/CA) on IEEE 802.11p is unable to satisfy for platooning needs due to unbounded delay especially under high channel load. Several researches about platooning are involved with medium access control (MAC) layer modification in a protocol stack and/or does not support variable number of vehicles and/or have a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose to use a vehicular desynchronization TDMA-based protocol over off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11p, while supporting vehicles joining and leaving a platoon and having no single point of failure. We recommend a range of parameters that are suitable for the platooning application. Our evaluation shows that using our suggested parameters, the vehicular desynchronization protocol could support a high-frequency beaconing with up to 16 vehicles at 100 Hz beaconing.",

Utilization of industrial wastes as an alternative material for fuel is gaining interest due to its environmental friendliness. Thus, the objective of this research was to study the optimum condition for fuel briquettes produced from wastewater sludge of the beer industry and biodiesel production wastes. This research is divided into two parts. Part I will study the effects of carbonization of brewery wastewater sludge for high fixed carbon. Part II will study the ratio between brewery wastewater sludge and bleaching earth for its high heating value. The results show that the maximum fixed carbon of 10.01% by weight was obtained at a temperature of 350 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. The appropriate ratio of brewery wastewater sludge and bleaching earth by weight was 95:5. This condition provided the highest heating value of approximately 3548.10 kcal/kg.",

The simulated results under predetermined conditions revealed that the methanol yield of 28.88%, CO2 permeation factor of 99.24% and water permeation factor of 89.64% were obtained from the MMR, which were higher than those obtained from the TMR. This was attributed to the fact that the high surface area-to-volume ratio of MMR provided superior heat and mass transfer rate for the reactions, resulting in a better performance of the reactor. Furthermore, the operating and design parameters of MMR were also investigated. It was found that the mass flow ratio of gas in biogas channels (BC) to that in reaction channels (RC) and Weight hour space velocity (WHSV) in RC significantly affected the reactor performance. Finally, the reactions of methanol synthesis in MMR were proved toovercome the equilibrium limitation at low pressure.

This allows developers to access GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements; therefore, precise positioning could be determined. Some limitation is that the location of the embedded GNSS antenna (and phase centre) within the Smartphones is not disclosed by any manufacturers. This paper aims to determine Xiaomi Mi8's GNSS antenna phase centre and its performances. The positioning accuracy is computed and later compared with a controlled position where the observations are obtained by a GNSS survey receiver; Trimble R10 where the nearest Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) with baseline length of approximately 5.3 km is used as reference base stations in relative positioning computations. Their positioning results are achieved from a commercial GNSS processing software; CHC Geomatics Office (CGO) version 1.0.6. It is found that the Mi8 GNSS antenna phase centre is located on the top left of the Smartphone; approximately 2.8 cm from the centre and 0.9 cm from the top edge. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in Northings, Eastings and elevations are within centimetre level of accuracy when the screen is facing upwards. It could be concluded that a Smartphone Mi8 is capable to determine precise positions when the GNSS antenna phase centre is known and the integer phase ambiguities are correctly resolved.",

In this context, building blocks are common structure of high- quality solutions. The compact genetic algorithm is an extension of the genetic algorithm that replaces the latter's population of chromosomes with a probability distribution from which candidate solutions can be generated. This paper describes an algorithm that exploits building blocks with compact genetic algorithm in order to solve difficult optimization problems under the assumption that we have already known building blocks. The main idea is to update the probability vectors as a group of bits that represents building blocks thus avoiding the disruption of the building blocks. Comparisons of the new algorithm with a conventional compact genetic algorithm on trap-function and traveling salesman problems indicate the utility of the proposed algorithm. It is most effective when the problem instants have common structures that can be identify as building blocks.",

This study investigates and compares the utilization of spent rock wool from industrial insulation and printed circuit boards (PCBs) (the non-metallic part) as a partial replacement for conventional fine aggregates in cement mortar. Each of the waste materials was used as a partial fine aggregate ranging from 0% to 20%, by weight. The cement mortar samples were cured at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. To investigate the properties of the cement mortars with different amounts of industrial wastes, the density, compressive strength, transverse strength and thermal conductivity of each mortar variation were measured. The results indicate that the compressive and transverse strengths of the cement mortars decreased as more industrial wastes was present in the mixtures. However, the fine aggregate substitutes improved thermal resistance, as indicated by the decreasing thermal conductivity values of the cement mortars. Thus, the use of these two industrial wastes in cement mortar could be a viable option for non-structural and non-load bearing construction applications because these substitutes have the ability to produce mortar with suitable mechanical and insulating properties.",

The TiO2 supports were commercially available pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 21 and 43 nm with specific surface area 63 and 10 m2/g, respectively), solvothermal-synthesized pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 15 nm, 69 m2/g), P-25 TiO2 (mixed anatase/rutile phase, 46 m2/g), and rutile TiO2 (dXRD 40 nm, 6 m2/g). In order to obtain high catalytic activity of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts, a combination of highly dispersed vanadium oxides and a strong interaction of V-Ti species were found to be necessary. As revealed by the XPS, Raman, and O2-TPD results, the interaction between active V component and TiO2 support was shown by the presence of partially reduced V-Ti species. Due to the strong interaction between V and TiO2 support, the active V component, which was not fully oxidized, led to more oxygen vacancies being formed and facilitated a rapid catalyst regeneration from V4+ to V5+ (re-oxidation). Hence, the capability of the catalysts for H2S removal was greatly enhanced. Among them, the V2O5 supported on anatase TiO2 with dXRD 21 nm exhibited the best catalyst performances using the feed molar ratio (O2/H2S) of 0.5.",

The measured surface potential was used to calculate the electric field by using the finite element method (FEM). The simulation model is axisymmetric having boundary conditions based on the measured potential. The surface charge density was then calculated from the normal electric field in the PMMA side and that in the air side. The comparison of estimated results and simulation results of surface charge density was made. The surface potential distribution was initially bell-shaped then decreased with time. The mechanism of electric conduction through the volume of insulation and charge neutralization by ambient gas ions influenced the surface potential decay. In the case of thicker PMMA, the reduction of surface potential distribution was fast in comparison with other cases. The estimated surface charge density was similar to the simulation results.",

A weakly singular boundary integral equation method together with the near-front approximation is adopted to accurately determine the intensity factors. Obtained results indicate that the non-flat crack surface, the electric field, and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap play a crucial role on the behavior of intensity factors. The mode-I stress intensity factors (KI) for two representative non-planar cracks under different crack-face conditions are found significantly different and they possess both upper and lower bounds. In addition, KI for impermeable and semi-permeable non-planar cracks treated depends strongly on the electric field whereas those of impermeable, permeable, and semi-permeable penny-shaped cracks are identical and independent of the electric field. The stress/electric intensity factors predicted by permeable and energetically consistent models are, respectively, independent of and dependent on the electric field for the penny-shaped crack and the two representative non-planar cracks. Also, the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap strongly affects the intensity factors for all crack configurations considered except for KI of the semi-permeable penny-shaped crack.",

The right-to-left approach is easier to parallelize than the conventional left-to-right approach.

By simplifying the implementation by Robert, we devise a mathematical model to capture the computation time of the calculation. Then, for any arbitrary amount of doubling time and addition time, we propose algorithms to generate representations which minimize the time in that model. As a result, we can show a negative result that a conventional representation like NAF is almost optimal. The parallel computation time obtained from any representation cannot be better than NAF by more than 1%.",

After being subjected to heat treatment, the size of the gamma prime particles was slightly reduced with increasing rhenium content. Then, the alloys were exposed at a temperature of 1173 K for 1800 ks. The results showed that increasing the rhenium addition leads to a slower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. Furthermore, the shape of the gamma prime particles changed to a more cubic shape. However, an excessive rhenium content (>1.21 wt.-%) promotes the formation of a topologically close-packed phase after a 360 ks exposure at 1173 K. It can be concluded that an increase in rhenium content can result in a lower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. The cobalt addition is beneficial for impeding or slowing the precipitation of topologically close-packed phases at an elevated temperature.",

The evidence suggested that various ratios of TMB/P123 can differently control the mesostructure including the pore size, specific surface area, and pore volume. Particularly, MCF-C 3.5 catalyst (TMB/P123 of 3.5) enhanced the catalytic via ethanol dehydrogenation.

Furthermore, the MCF-C 3.5 evidently exhibited outstanding stability at temperature of 400 \u00b0C for 12 h.

However, all of the studies are based on very-high resolution satellite images, and surprisingly; none of them are implemented on medium resolution satellite images. Moreover, no research has applied geoinformatics knowledge. Therefore, we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation models, which are FCN, SegNet, and GSN using medium resolution images from Landsat-8 satellite. In addition, we propose a modified SegNet model that can be used with remote sensing derived indices.
